# DualSense Bluetooth waveform validation

Requires SDL 2.24 or newer and the repository's pinned moonlight-common-c
revision (including `ControllerHaptics.h`). Linux:

```sh
mkdir -p build/tests-haptics
cd build/tests-haptics
qmake6 ../../tests/haptics/haptics.pro
make -j10
./tst_dualsensehaptics
```

Use the same `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` and runtime `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` as the application
if it links a local SDL build. On Windows, from an x64 Native Tools prompt with
Qt's `bin` directory on PATH:

```bat
mkdir build\tests-haptics
cd build\tests-haptics
qmake ..\..\tests\haptics\haptics.pro CONFIG+=release
nmake
set "PATH=..\..\libs\windows\lib\x64;%PATH%"
release\tst_dualsensehaptics.exe
```

The opt-in `tests/tests.pro` tree also builds this suite, and Windows CI runs it.
The test uses a recording HID output and a virtual controller; it does not open
a physical controller. It exercises the production worker and resampler, checks
both channels and the Bluetooth CRC, bounded queue behavior, packet loss and
duplicates, idle/removal silence, write failure and SDL trigger payload dispatch.
Some sdl2-compat versions invert virtual effect callback return values; that
check asserts the dispatched bytes, not the virtual driver's return status.

For real playback, use the coordinated Vibeshine and Moonlight builds. Pair the
DualSense/Edge to the Windows or Linux **client**, select DS5 (or automatic PlayStation
emulation) on the host, then reconnect the stream. The client log must contain
`DualSense Bluetooth waveform backend ready`. Linux USB connections and
unsupported clients keep conventional rumble. The game must send native haptic
PCM to the Linux host virtual controller's audio endpoint. Windows uses its
built-in HID driver and the exact device path owned by SDL; no controller-name
matching or virtual Xbox translation is used. A controller hidden from Moonlight
by another input mapper will not expose native waveform/trigger support.

Check distinct left/right native effects while moving both sticks and using
adaptive triggers; stop the effect, pause/end the stream, disconnect/reconnect
Bluetooth and repeat. Verify an older client still receives rumble. A working
backend log or passing recording-output test alone is not physical haptics validation.

Specifically verify that LEDs and repeated adaptive-trigger changes do not
interrupt a sustained waveform, and that input, conventional rumble after PCM
idles, reconnects, multiple controllers and stream exit still work. Check the
log for `Adaptive trigger output failed` or `DualSense waveform output failed`.

The Windows transport follows Microsoft's [continuous HID output guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/hid/sending-hid-reports)
and the maximum-report padding used by [SDL's Windows HID backend](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/SDL2/src/hidapi/windows/hid.c).
The wire payload and its CRC remain the pinned SAxense adaptation.

`moonlight --haptics-license` prints the embedded source and notices; see
[`PROVENANCE.md`](../../third-party/saxense/PROVENANCE.md) for the pinned source,
licenses and distribution requirements.

## Windows USB waveform playback

A USB DualSense/Edge uses its own four-channel WASAPI playback endpoint, matched
by the exact SDL HID device container. It uses inbox Windows drivers and sends
actuator PCM only to channels 3/4, keeping channels 1/2 silent. The log must show
`DualSense USB waveform backend ready ... (WASAPI)`. A stereo endpoint is rejected;
keep the controller playback device in its default four-channel format.

Validate USB separately on Windows hardware using the left/right native effects,
input, adaptive-trigger, idle, disconnect/reconnect and stream-exit checks above.
Confirm the headset channels remain silent. The deterministic recording-output
test exercises Bluetooth and the shared receive queue; it does not validate
WASAPI discovery, engine buffering or physical USB feedback. USB hardware
validation is pending.
