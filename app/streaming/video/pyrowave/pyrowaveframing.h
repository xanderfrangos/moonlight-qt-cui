// Parses one PyroWave frame as delivered by moonlight-common-c into the runs of
// PyroWave records that pyrowave_decoder_push_packet() accepts. Supports both
// framings in docs/pyrowave-protocol.md:
//
//  - Record framing: a sequence header, block records and padding records
//    (0xFFFFFFFF, N, N zero words), concatenated.
//  - Length-prefixed framing: [u32 count] { [u32 size] [packet] } * count.
//
// Everything that reaches the decoder is validated here first: a block record
// shorter than its header, a record running past the frame, a sequence header
// for another size or chroma mode, or an out-of-range block index rejects the
// whole frame. Frames are independent, so the next frame simply replaces it.
//
// A record-framed frame may arrive with packets missing (zero-filled by
// moonlight-common-c). Records that lost any byte are skipped. When a record
// header itself was lost, parsing resumes at the next received packet that the
// host flagged as starting with a record. Without flags, it resumes at the next
// received packet once the finer levels' oversized records (larger than a
// packet, sent before their other records) are behind, since the host packs
// every other record without crossing a packet boundary. The frame is then
// marked partial.
//
// A partial frame is only worth decoding if every block of the coarsest wavelet
// level arrived. The host sends those blocks (block indices below
// coarseBlockCount()) first, right after the sequence header, protects the
// packets holding them with parity, and announces how many packets that is in
// the frame header. Hosts that do not announce it still send them first, so
// they are known to be intact when no loss precedes the first finer block.
