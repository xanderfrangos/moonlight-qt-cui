# Streaming, VRR, and timing architecture

This is the persistent technical orientation for this fork. Read it at the start
of a session working on streaming, decoding, rendering, VRR, latency, or replay.
It explains the implementation and the reasoning needed to investigate it;
it does not establish that a particular deployed executable matches the source.

Linux Vulkan FSR1 integration (2026-09-24, based on upstream PR #1557): the
opt-in `fsr1upscaling` preference selects the libplacebo Vulkan frontend when
available and attaches the PR's SDR/PQ FSR1 luma hooks to this fork's existing
render parameters. Libplacebo debands the source planes before the luma hook
and dithers the final output afterward. Both direct and optional offscreen VRR
preparation use the same hook selection, preserving the existing worker and
presenter timing policy. The hook only runs when output area exceeds source
size; a failed shader parse falls back to ordinary Vulkan scaling. The option
is hidden outside Linux builds with Vulkan support and defaults off. Added
GPU work may alter frame readiness and must be measured live; this source
change alone does not establish throughput or smoothness.

On successful `LiStartConnection()`, the session records the connection start
time. `Session::exec()` owns the SDL event loop while streaming, so it raises
the stream window once two seconds have elapsed there; a QML timer would not
run during that loop.

Reduce judder follow-up (2026-09-22), based on `e053b5cb`: the smoother's
positive retiming cap rises from 2 ms to 6 ms, a learned readiness reserve
delays the smoothed schedule by the lateness the smoother itself causes, and
phase-error feedback lets its period follow drifting game rates. All three are
new zero-default controller parameters, so older captures replay unchanged.
See the section below and section 8.3.

Windows high-bitrate follow-up (2026-09-22), based on `26675aa8`: D3D11 VRR
presentation no longer holds FFmpeg's decode lock on separate devices, and a
monitored decode fence now supplies the decode-completion observation that
production source mapping assumes. See the section below and section 10.1.

Controller-feedback update (2026-09-19), checked against `9362b0f0` and its
common-library waveform protocol: section 12 now covers Windows
Bluetooth waveform output and the shared adaptive-trigger path. This update
does not change video timing or replay policy.

Reference baseline: `06fae71f` (vrr17 branch), plus the client-warning and
gradual backlog-recovery follow-up described below. This includes source ownership,
buffer attribution and decode-wait starvation prevention (2026-09-20).
The Windows buffer-retention follow-up is based on `e1df34b7` (2026-09-21).
Production now records `playout_recent_pressure_release=2`: only a fresh,
readiness-attributed interval error with absorbable service renews the existing
clean-time hold. Submission jitter after readiness and sustained service
overload still lower the timing score, but cannot indefinitely retain previously
acquired buffer. The preset hold durations, release rates, growth law and caps
are unchanged. Revisions 0/1 retain their historical replay behavior. This is a
shared-policy correction, not evidence that Windows GPU execution became faster.
The selected Windows capture ends with zero attributed readiness lateness yet
revision 1 renews its full eight-second hold. Its recorded submissions and
controller diagnostics reproduce. The 2026-09-22 replay audit now recognizes
the D3D11 fence poll recorded at the final Present boundary, after preparation,
while retaining support for older preparation-poll traces. With that audit fix,
the selected `20260922-184032-168` capture passes exact controller/worker
replay. Its display model remains uncalibrated and cannot prove optical tearing
or tear freedom. Live improvement from the buffer change still requires a fresh
test.
The 2026-09-21 preparation-stage follow-up is based on `18602b1c`, including
Gemini's decode-completion source mapping and preparation-on-arrival changes.
Linux VAAPI/Mailbox has experimental offscreen preparation independently of the
pacing thread, as described in section 7.2. Following live 4K throughput
regressions, this requires `MOONLIGHT_VRR_OFFSCREEN_PREPARATION=1`; the default
retains the direct asynchronous hardware-source path. Other backends retain their
existing execution path. This changes execution overlap, not buffer ceilings
or source cadence policy; physical smoothness still requires a live retest.
Production now selects serial-service revision 2: the shared interval buffer
compares workload with intended time over its qualified one-second window,
rather than treating one slow frame as sustained overload. Deferred D3D GPU
service counts residual CPU waiting, not intentional pacing hold; a fence
verified pending at the final wait supplies readiness lateness. Historical
revisions 0/1 remain available. See
[service-gate correction](docs/vrr-service-gate-correction.md).
Live GPU diagnostics now add a separate asynchronous CSV under existing deep
tracing: CPU dependency
spans, source-retirement bounds, output readiness before presentation, and
libplacebo's delayed shader-duration history. Shader samples are not tagged to
their originating frame and do not expose absolute GPU start times. See
[live GPU tracing](docs/gpu-live-tracing.md). That tracing does not alter replay
schema or policy; the service-gate correction above changes production policy.
GPU diagnostic revision 2 removes the decoder-thread surface-status query: live
revision-1 captures showed it blocking behind another frame's decode synchronization.
Revision 2 retained the worker-side query for retesting.
Revision 3 timestamps existing packet send/receive, packet delivery/assembly and
pacer handoff, associates output surfaces with frame IDs, and samples Linux
thread CPU time/context switches around send/receive, VA sync/status and render
commands. Decoder-thread instrumentation only reads metadata and OS counters;
it performs no new driver calls. These spans expose CPU-versus-blocked time and
cross-thread overlap, not internal driver locks or GPU engine execution times.
Revision 4 removes the worker-side VA status query as well. The latest completed
4K HEVC capture `20260921-005750-93776` recorded 1.05 ms mean and 7.62 ms p95
inside that diagnostic call, before the required `vaSyncSurface` wait. Timing
the existing synchronization preserves readiness and its measurements without
adding this potentially blocking probe. This removes diagnostic driver work;
some of its wait may move into synchronization, so FPS recovery is not implied.
The current follow-up enables early preparation on both platforms and
asynchronous VAAPI/Vulkan Mailbox output, described below. That follow-up still needs
live validation; the baseline's latest high-bitrate run delivers about 100 FPS
at a 120 FPS source despite the starvation improvement. The
earlier timing lineage remains `1ccefb6e` (vrr17.1), plus the buffer-accounting review and
initial-calibration follow-up (2026-09-18). Accounting adds separate buffer
reasons, latency breakdowns and replay audits. The follow-up restores vrr14's
slot-only presentation-protection threshold, expands the preset allowances to
2/2/4 source frames, and shortens initial qualification without accelerating
ongoing buffer growth. See [VRR17 review](docs/vrr17-review.md) for the historical
comparison and [calibration follow-up](docs/vrr17-calibration.md) for current
policy, tests and validation limits. The existing D3D11 4K binding eligibility change
(2026-09-17) means single-device streams at least 3840x2160 bind instead of copying
when Feature Level 11.1+ or D3D11 fences are available. Existing Intel and
separate-device binding, lower-resolution copy behavior and explicit overrides
are unchanged. That binding-only change left backbuffer clearing, context
locking, pacing, buffering, native presentation and replay alone. Its subsequent
raster-guard, buffer-first and startup/replay experiments have been removed at
the user's request after continued tearing; their changes are archived outside
the worktree. This binding-only restoration is not yet live-confirmed tear-free.

The follow-up [user-facing diagnostics](docs/vrr-diagnostics.md) adds a shared
Windows/Linux **Trace VRR frames for debugging** checkbox and local ZIP export.
Recordings are saved in per-stream subfolders of `vrr-diagnostics` on the user's
Desktop. Tracing does not select or modify timing policies, and Moonlight does
not upload the logs. The unpublished timing-comparison selector was removed.

The baseline includes Linux VRR probe/playback color-range alignment
(2026-09-16), originally `352f4827` plus removal of the Allow tearing preference
(2026-09-15),
client-processing,
vrr14-style compact stats reporting, restored Reduce judder, reconnect
trace preservation, motion cadence telemetry, hard buffer ceiling, AMD low-latency decode request, observed-latency trace diagnostics, and removal of the latency oscillation test,
inspected 2026-09-15; now includes responsive readiness revision 4, desktop-rate isolation,
fence-value-verified Windows readiness waits, bounded Vulkan source retirement,
bounded GPU-readiness head-start adaptation, and cadence-gated,
elapsed-time source-offset recovery. The latency
presets and persistent Vulkan presentation changes remain active.
Windows and Linux share one production queue policy: mean absolute client-added
interval error over one second with a profile-selected tolerance (0.5 ms for Low
Latency and Balanced Target, 0.2 ms for Smooth), driving the severity-weighted
preset-duration quality score. Low Latency / Balanced Target / Smooth seek
99% / 99.5% / 99.99% over 1/2/5 minutes, with 6/8/10-second holds and
125/250/50 us-per-second release, within the shared three-frame queue and
1/2/4-source-frame allowances. Low Latency and Balanced Target remain capped at
16 ms, Smooth at 24 ms, all subject to the queue-capacity safety bound. These
are ceilings, not fixed delays or a larger physical queue.
Initial interval calibration requires at least 500 ms of contiguous coverage
and 32 valid intervals. Ordinary growth remains at most 250 us per 250 ms,
applied at most 125 us per frame. Once qualified, a sequence break requires the
historical one-second requalification; FPS changes cannot rearm fast startup.
Live sessions also cap the preset allowance against the fitted source period,
not only the negotiated stream rate. Successful Windows present-ready fence
waits and synchronous Linux Vulkan completion polls can feed a
separate bounded readiness lead: a recent p99 wait plus 500 us, clamped to 12 ms
and one source period. Linux VAAPI retains source mappings until their GPU reads
finish and uses the Mailbox swapchain's GPU semaphore for output completion.
Other presentation modes, imports and software frames retain the bounded CPU output poll. A learned
lead advances only the render-start deadline; it does not move the source
presentation target or claim that the GPU will complete on time.
Explicit captured parameters keep the new controls
disabled unless the trace records them, preserving exact replay of older captures.
The minimum remains 1 ms (subject to capacity). Five-minute version-20 raw
readiness calibration is diagnostic only and cannot inflate the live request.
Linux's event-gated history-version-19
policy is retired from live selection; explicit historical parameters remain
supported for exact replay. Linux calibration keys are segregated from that
retired policy. Native synchronization and presentation remain backend-specific.
Display feedback is optional diagnostic evidence and does not steer this policy.
The former V2 Queue A/B checkbox and its runtime configuration fields are removed.
The saved `v2queue` setting is ignored and removed on save, so previously disabled
installations also use the new queue. Legacy policies remain only for explicit
historical diagnostic configurations. Reconnect after changing latency presets.
Updated 2026-09-18: displayed frame queue delay still excludes the worker's
explicit GPU decode synchronization wait. Existing decoding, queue and rendering
statistics keep their definitions. Advanced tracing shows the wait on its own
labelled line; it is never merged into an old statistic. Full decoder-output-to-Present-
return time remains diagnostic, with no new aggregate overlay headline. Queue
plus rendering plus that separate wait partitions internal client processing.
The initial map came from nine Luna Medium specialists, followed by
targeted source checks and corrections. No live capture, optical measurement,
build, or test run was part of this documentation investigation. Recheck the
named functions after changes; comments, diagnostic labels, and old experiments
can disagree with the active implementation. The historical D3D11 latch mismatch described below
is one concrete example; the current native boundary now forwards the selected interval.
Historical 2026-09-08 builds selected `playout_adaptive_only=1`. The current
production resolver uses `playout_adaptive_only=0` and per-frame latch requests;
source-rate/presentation safety decisions can therefore select a latched frame.
Explicit captured parameters preserve both behaviors in replay.
Updated on 2026-09-10: the forced-composition and per-frame repaint checkboxes
have been retired. Their saved settings (and the older Mailbox preference) are
ignored and removed on settings save. Session startup no longer invokes the
composition guard and passes repaint=false to the decoder. Dormant renderer
helpers and their deterministic tests remain available for development.
Production retains its Immediate/WSI FIFO selection; adaptive presentation
permission is owned by the VRR backend rather than a user preference.

### Reduce judder readiness reserve and wider retiming (2026-09-22)

Written on the Sunshine host (Ambidex), which has no client toolchain, traces or
share access. Evidence is a synthetic harness around the real controller
(g++ with FFmpeg/SDL stubs) plus new deterministic tests; no capture replay,
application build or live test accompanied it.

Two defects limited what Reduce judder could correct:

1. **Readiness clamps undid the smoothing.** Centering a smoothed schedule on
   uneven stamps moves late-stamped frames earlier than their raw slot. Because
   arrival follows the stamp, those frames are frequently not ready: the target
   clamp presents them late and restores the step. The negative bound was the
   whole playout delay, i.e. down to the mapped source slot itself. The
   interval-quality buffer does not respond, because 1-2 ms errors on 5-17% of
   frames average under its 0.5 ms tolerance. The 2026-09-10 SteamOS capture
   showed the same thing live: 0.4% of intended pairs over 2 ms jerk, 13.8%
   after readiness clamps.
2. **The 2 ms positive cap was too small** for host-refresh quantization. A
   game at 90 FPS captured from a fixed 120 Hz host arrives as 8.3/8.3/16.7 ms
   stamps, needing roughly ±2.8 ms of retiming; 100 or 110 FPS need more. The
   cap also clipped only one side, pulling the schedule early.

A third limitation affected drifting rates: the period followed a 2.5% interval
EMA only, so a game ramping between 70 and 100 FPS left the smoothed slot
several milliseconds from its stamps (≈2.7 ms mean in the new drift fixture).

Changes, all active only with Reduce judder enabled:

- `playout_smoothing_max_lag_us` 2000 → 6000.
- `playout_smoothing_reserve_*` (max 3000 us, p980, tolerance 500 us, release
  500 us/s): for each frame the smoother placed, the controller records
  `min(readyOffset - playoutDelay, 0) - retiming`, the lateness caused by moving
  the frame before its raw slot. Delivery that misses the raw slot remains
  playout-buffer evidence. Worker backlog is excluded because it follows the
  previous, already-reserved target and would feed the reserve back into
  itself. The reserve is the p98 of the last 128 such values minus the
  tolerance, acquired at most 250 us per frame after 32 samples, and it is
  applied to every timestamp-playout frame while smoothing is enabled, so
  cadence resets do not step by the reserve. It shares the 6 ms positive
  retiming budget and is reported inside `cadence_smoothing_us`, never
  `playout_delay_us`. The controller exposes it as `smoothingReserveUs()`;
  there is no dedicated trace column.
- `playout_smoothing_period_feedback_per_million=20000`: the smoothed period
  also integrates 2% of each frame's phase error (a second-order tracking loop,
  damping about 0.5 with the 15% phase gain).

Synthetic results (60 s, three seeds, host-present stamps plus delivery jitter
of 0.35 ms mean with 1% 2-5 ms spikes; per mille of pairs over 2 ms jerk,
mean decode-to-submission change against Reduce judder off). The harness lets
Balanced release to its 1 ms floor, so its row is a small-buffer worst case:

| Content | Balanced previous → new | Low Latency previous → new | Smooth previous → new |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 90 FPS on a 120 Hz host | 442 → 50‰, +0.34 → +1.31 ms | 194 → 28‰, -0.25 → +0.42 ms | 47 → 2‰, -0.53 → +0.00 ms |
| 70 FPS on a 120 Hz host | 458 → 39‰, -0.23 → +1.39 ms | 231 → 23‰, -0.64 → +0.45 ms | 71 → 2‰, -0.86 → +0.00 ms |
| 70-100 FPS ramp on a 120 Hz host | 562 → 86‰, +0.11 → +1.54 ms | 370 → 44‰, -0.59 → +0.63 ms | 201 → 8‰, -0.56 → +0.03 ms |
| Paced 90 FPS, 2 ms stamp jitter | 80 → 25‰, -0.37 → +0.08 ms | 70 → 21‰, -0.40 → +0.03 ms | 67 → 20‰, -0.42 → +0.01 ms |
| Even 120 FPS | 18 → 17‰, +0.00 → +0.00 ms | 5 → 5‰, 0 → 0 ms | 0 → 0‰, 0 → 0 ms |

The previous policy's negative latency deltas are the early bias the one-sided
cap introduced, not free smoothing. Random-walk frame pacing (a game whose own
frame times vary by 2-3 ms) improves less and costs more (Balanced 60 FPS,
3 ms: 352 → 182‰ for +1.9 ms), because no smooth line stays close to it.

The new deterministic fixtures (`testReduceJudder*`) cover 90 FPS on a 120 Hz
host with production and tight buffers (tight: 68.1% → 1.0% of pairs over 2 ms,
+0.9 ms), even stamps with delivery spikes (no reserve may be acquired), reserve
release once pacing becomes even, and a 70-100 FPS ramp (standing retiming
offset about 2.7 → 0.56 ms). All existing controller fixtures pass unchanged
except the assertions that named the old 2 ms cap. The replay-config round trip
test was added but not compiled here (it needs Qt).

**Cadence-reset easing (2026-09-22 evening, ALLYTWO).** Capture
`20260922-193211-380` (116 FPS on the 120 Hz LG, game at 112-116 FPS, host
stamps on a ~2.15 ms grid) showed that a four-interval slowdown of the game
(10.7-12.9 ms frames) fails the windowed stability gate, and the reset dropped
the accumulated retiming (often -5 ms) to zero in one frame, so a 10.7 ms host
interval was presented as 13.8-15.9 ms. The smoothing value logged in
`cadence_smoothing_us` includes the reserve, so resets never read as zero there;
identify them by a step in retiming, not by a zero value.
`playout_smoothing_reset_slew_us` (production 1000 with Reduce judder, 0
otherwise and in older captures) now eases the previous frame's retiming toward
the raw slot by at most that much per frame when the smoother resets, within the
same positive cap and negative `-(playout delay + reserve)` bound. A new clock
epoch (`rebased`) and a phase reseed still jump. The eased slot becomes the next
smoothed basis, so a re-engaged smoother continues from it. Replay of 193211
with a display model (latched presents queue behind the previous flip, adaptive
presents flip at call + 1.28 ms): steady-state distinct snaps (displayed jerk
over 4 ms) 36 → 27 in 59 s, client-stretched snaps 10 → 4, latency unchanged,
0 modelled tears. The remaining 21 are host intervals of 12-21 ms passed through.
The earlier 97 FPS capture `184032-168` is neutral (71 → 73). Fixture
`testReduceJudderEasesCadenceResets`: >2 ms pairs 2.7% → 2.0%. Not a
calibration-key change. Also from that capture: the first 7 s had 205 GPU
fence waits over 3 ms (none afterwards) where the CPU decode-completion wait
was short and rendering queued behind decode, a startup transient.

Still required on ALLYTWO: the Qt suites, exact replay of the newest capture
(captured parameters lack the new fields, so it should still reproduce), a
`configs/judder-reserve-variants.json` batch on real captures, and a live
comparison. The synthetic harness does not model GPU render variance, the
decode wait, stale-frame dropping or native presentation.

Not addressed: with a 120 FPS stream, a sub-60 FPS game on a 60 Hz host
(16.7/33.3 ms stamps) never fits its source period. Each 33 ms interval is a
major cadence departure at the 8.3 ms negotiated period, and the following
16.7 ms interval counts as a return to stable cadence, clearing the cadence
window. The fitted period stays at 8.3 ms, every long interval is a phase
discontinuity, and smoothing never engages. This is a rate-detection issue
(section 8.2), not a smoother setting.

### Windows decode/presentation decoupling (2026-09-22)

Two Windows-only gaps against the Linux path were found from source, both
growing with bitrate. No live capture, build or replay accompanied the change;
this document was written on the host machine, which has no client toolchain.

1. **Shared decode lock.** FFmpeg's D3D11VA hwaccel holds the renderer-supplied
   lock for its whole per-frame submission (`DecoderBeginFrame` through
   `DecoderEndFrame`, including the bitstream copy). The VRR worker held that
   same mutex through preparation, the render-context `Flush`, `Present` and
   the DXGI statistics queries, and took it twice more around the present-ready
   wait. With a playout buffer near one source period, frame N's target lands
   near frame N+1's decode submission, so the collision recurs with the cadence
   and lengthens as larger frames make submission slower. Stock Moonlight, and
   this fork's legacy path, take the lock only for decode-context calls on
   separate devices. This is the Windows form of the Linux finding in
   [live GPU tracing](docs/gpu-live-tracing.md): decoder-thread driver work
   serialized behind the worker's wait on another frame.
   `D3D11VARenderer` now has a separate presentation mutex for the render
   context, swapchain and prepared-frame state, shared with window-change
   callbacks and legacy rendering. It includes FFmpeg's lock only when decode
   and render share one immediate context. `renderVideo()` takes FFmpeg's lock
   solely around its decode-context `Signal`/`Wait`. Lock order is presentation,
   then context; the decoder thread takes only the context lock.
2. **No decode-completion observation.** Production maps source time from
   `decodeCompleteUs` so hardware decode time is absorbed into the sender
   offset (`93363745`). Linux supplies it from `vaSyncSurface()`. `78b99f1c`
   had made the Windows decode check nonblocking, so `decodeCompleteUs`
   stayed equal to decoder output, which precedes the hardware decode. The
   whole decode duration then had to fit inside the capped playout buffer and
   the residual present-ready wait. `waitForDecode()` again waits for the exact
   captured decode-to-render fence value, without any context lock, using a
   dedicated event. The GPU-side `Wait` in `renderVideo()` remains the
   correctness mechanism. The CPU wait applies only to monitored fences; the CPU
   cannot observe non-monitored fences, and shared-device sessions capture no
   boundary, so both keep the previous nonblocking behavior. A failed or 50 ms
   timed-out wait disables adaptive presentation and requests recovery without
   advertising readiness. The last user-confirmed smooth Windows 4K capture
   (2026-09-11, below) ran with this style of blocking decode wait.

Expected trace differences: Windows rows gain nonzero `decode_sync_wait_us`,
as Linux rows have; `gpu_ready_wait_us` at the target should fall toward
zero; the lock-wait spans `gpu_ready_poll_start_us - present_start_us` and
`native_present_start_us - gpu_ready_time_us` should no longer track the next
frame's `decoder_output_us`. These changes do not alter controller parameters,
buffer caps or replay policy. They require a Windows build, the deterministic
suites, exact replay of a new capture and a matched high-bitrate live test.

### Client warnings and gradual backlog recovery (2026-09-20)

With Reduce judder enabled, production captures `playout_catchup_per_mille=20`.
Recovery arms only after replaceable queue age exceeds one source period.
A soft submission floor limits catch-up initially to a two-percent reduction
in source interval. Between one and two source periods of replaceable queue
age, it continuously allows more recovery, up to the display period plus guard.
There is no extra floor without display headroom. The existing native
protection decision is retained, including any latched present. Each added
hold is bounded by the two-period stale deadline and at most 1 ms beyond the
otherwise safe slot. Persistent stalls cannot authorize an unlimited slow drain. Source timestamps, dynamic reserve demand and
hard queue capacity are unchanged. The decode wait is excluded from replaceable
queue age; existing stale-frame rejection remains the last safeguard. Cadence
breaks, rate transitions and unqualified source timing bypass this floor.
The recovery parameter is included in the calibration identity. Zero preserves historical
capture behavior; Reduce judder disabled also retains the former recovery.
This smooths compression after stalls, but cannot guarantee preservation of every
frame under overload, eliminate GPU waits, or prove physical scanout smoothness.

Client warnings sample fresh pacing drops/late-preparation counters once per
reporting interval, independently of the performance overlay. A buffer at its
limit without fresh late/drop evidence does not warn. Sustained qualified
one-second service overload has a distinct warning and never suggests more
buffering. Both client warnings require the buffer to be at its maximum and
the displayed measured smoothness score to be at or below 99%, regardless of
preset. Leaving the cap or recovering above 99% hides them immediately.
Missing qualification also suppresses them. Warnings require three seconds of startup and two seconds of
persistent evidence, clear after five seconds without that evidence, and have
a thirty-second repeat cooldown. Reporting gaps over 2.5 seconds restart
qualification. They follow the existing connection-quality-warning preference.
HEVC is suggested only for active AV1 with an initialization-time hardware
HEVC probe matching the stream's HDR/chroma/resolution; Smooth is suggested
only for a capped buffer when a different preset is selected. No setting changes
automatically. Diagnostic `serviceOverloaded` does not change buffer control.

Network and client messages retain independent status sources. Mouse-mode text
has display priority while retaining both warnings; clearing any source cannot
clear the others. Client pacing counters do not feed the network frame-gap
counter or the transport connection callback. Those existing delivery-loss
signals do not diagnose a specific network component or internal GPU cause.

### Cross-platform ownership and buffer-attribution correction (2026-09-19)

Production source-clock mapping now uses immutable `decoderOutputUs`. A worker or
backend completion wait is local service after decoder output; changing when that
wait is polled must not move the RTP-to-client clock offset, source slot, stale-age
origin, or cadence state. `decodeCompleteUs` remains a conservative readiness
observation for historical policies, and `decodeSyncWaitUs` records explicit CPU
waiting separately. The old `decoderOutputUs + residualWaitUs` construction was
self-dependent: queue residence could shorten a residual wait without changing
the real completion time. A material wait now records the post-wait clock as an
upper completion bound instead. The three new controls default to zero when
absent so old captures retain their recorded mapping, service and release rules:
`playout_source_mapping_decoder_output`, `playout_serial_service_gate`, and
`playout_recent_pressure_release`.

The live interval buffer now separates delivery variation from serial local
service. Serial service includes the explicit decoder wait, preparation work
excluding swapchain acquisition, and render-scheduler delay; a deferred backend
completion contributes its actual residual CPU wait in revision 2. Revision 1
used the conservative full preparation-to-observation upper bound. Growth is eligible only when the attributed frame is late and the qualified
window has capacity for measured serial service and decoder-queue pressure.
Revision 1 tested only one pair; revision 2 uses the total smoothed intended
interval time over the same one-second window as interval pressure.
Extra standing delay cannot make a pipeline whose serial work exceeds its slot
process frames faster. The preset's long severity-weighted history remains part
of quality reporting and attack qualification, while only recent current pressure
renews the clean-time release hold. Old below-target score debt therefore no
longer pins live delay after the recent disturbance ends; historical policies
retain the former hold behavior.

Windows queues the frame's decode dependency on the GPU, records the backbuffer,
signals and flushes a present-ready fence during preparation, then lets the GPU
run during the worker's cadence hold. At the target boundary it verifies the exact
fence value and waits only for any residual work before `Present`. The
presentation lock is released during both the cadence hold and that residual
wait, and the source `AVFrame` stays owned through presentation. Since
2026-09-22 that lock is not FFmpeg's decode lock on separate devices, and a
monitored decode fence is waited on before scheduling (see the 2026-09-22
section above). Linux VAAPI keeps
one explicit worker readiness synchronization but removes the duplicate explicit
prepare-time synchronization. Hardware Vulkan preparation retains the imported
source mapping until GPU completion. The VAAPI Mailbox path now uses libplacebo's
render-complete presentation semaphore without an additional CPU output wait.
Other presentation modes, imports and software frames retain the bounded output-completion poll.
Both platforms spend the existing playout interval on preparation, with
`playout_prepare_on_arrival=1` and `render_start_after_submission_us=0`.
This is necessary for the asynchronous path: without a CPU completion sample,
it cannot rely on that sample to learn an adequate GPU render-ahead allowance.
Presentation targets, buffer limits and native interval protection are unchanged.

These changes improve overlap and prevent unabsorbable local work from buying
more buffer; they do not prove lower visible latency or smoother scanout. Windows
fence poll/event timestamps are conservative CPU observation bounds, and a fence
first checked at the target can have completed earlier during the cadence hold.
Linux source retirement proves that imported reads can be released. The fallback
output poll supplies a separate CPU completion upper bound. Neither observation
is a hardware timestamp, and a Windows completion first observed at the target
can conservatively overstate service. Passing the service gate is not proof of
complete GPU throughput headroom. Native display feedback and physical scanout
remain separate evidence.

### Cadence qualification correction (2026-09-19)

Production records `playout_smoothing_windowed_cadence=2`. Reduce judder
qualifies a rolling four-interval mean within 25% of the fitted source period.
There is no additional recovery timeout (`playout_smoothing_recovery_us=0`);
the source-rate detector retains its independent transition confirmation.
This replaces the single-interval/compensating-pair stability gate, whose
threshold was repeatedly crossed by 90 kHz RTP rounding near 6.25/10.42 ms
at 120 FPS, especially when normal intervals interrupted alternating pairs.
Revision 2 also tolerates one RTP tick of rounding at the half-period bound
and a short interval down to one quarter-period when the preceding long
interval compensates it and their mean is within 25% of the fitted period.

Missing frames, invalid source timing, phase/epoch discontinuities, detected
rate changes, uncompensated bursts and intervals above 2.5 periods discard
qualification evidence. Four new consecutive intervals are required. Storage
is fixed; this does not wait for future frames or add a frame queue.
Historical captures default to revision 0 and a 200 ms recovery timeout;
revision 1 retains the four-interval gate with the original burst bound.
Both retain their original integer period updates for exact replay.

The selected blend keeps 85% of the predicted slot and 15% of the raw slot,
with a 2.5% period EMA. Revision 2 retains fractional EMA updates so a slow
filter cannot leave permanent period error after a source-rate change.
Positive retiming remains capped at 2 ms. The cadence correction itself leaves
preset buffer caps, quality targets, holds and release rates unchanged; the
current policy's later Balanced release adjustment is described with the live
interval queue below. Calibration identity includes all five
smoothing parameters so old readiness profiles cannot cross-seed this policy.

Replay now audits first-frame GPU readiness using the row's captured responsive
revision before constructing the controller. Previously that one row could be
checked with the older queue-inclusive rule, falsely rejecting valid output-
plus-blocking-wait timestamps. The timestamp constraints are unchanged.

Validation: all six required deterministic VRR suites, diagnostics and overlay
checks pass; the native application builds and passes offscreen help. The latest
Balanced, preceding Smooth and earlier Balanced captures from the September 19
20:53 run pass exact historical replay, as do new and revision-1 cold/warm and
first-frame GPU-wait fixtures. Eleven diagnostic-tampering checks remain
rejected. Final rebuilt replay matches the selected override to the production
resolver on every capture.

On the latest Balanced capture, presented jerk above 2 ms falls from 66.6% in
the original recording to 25.0% with revision 1, then 10.2% with this policy.
Against revision 1, median jerk falls from 1.540 to 0.393 ms and mean decoder-
output-to-submission latency from 10.189 to 9.806 ms. p99 latency is essentially
unchanged (13.173 to 13.182 ms); p99.95 remains 24.684 ms. Rare jerk tails do
not uniformly improve: p99.95 increases from 10.300 to 12.148 ms. Preceding
Smooth improves from 26.9% to 5.8% over 2 ms; earlier Balanced from 34.9% to
17.4%, with a 0.236 ms mean latency increase in that backlogged capture. These
are within-capture policy comparisons, not matched gameplay comparisons
between presets.

Four nominal/fault scenarios pass zero modeled interval violations, 16 ms
reserve and 20 ms p99 latency bounds without worker saturation. These are
fixed-admission controller results, not live GPU or physical scanout validation;
the captures have no usable raster phase coverage. Input identities, full
metrics, tradeoffs and final build hashes are in
`build/judder-optimization-20260919/validation.md`; reusable variants are in
`tests/vrr/configs/windowed-cadence-variants.json`.

### Source-offset transition recovery (2026-09-15)

Live Windows and Linux sessions now reject cadence-ineligible clock-offset
observations. A source-phase discontinuity retires the old minimum-observation
window while retaining the applied offset and the interval buffer. Subsequent
eligible observations recover at 2400 us per second of monotonic sender time,
with a 100 us per-observation cap. This retains the former 20 us/frame correction
rate at 120 FPS without making 60 FPS converge twice as slowly. Fractional credit
is retained, but rejected observations and capped stalls cannot bank future
catch-up steps. A genuine epoch reset clears the clock and fractional state.

Production now observes immutable decoder-output-minus-RTP. Unwrapped RTP time
ages the window and sets the correction budget, so worker queue residence,
decoder-fence poll timing, renderer work, and GPU completion waits cannot feed
back into the source-clock mapping. FFmpeg decoder service can still affect when
`decoderOutputUs` is sampled; the windowed minimum is an empirical mapping rather
than a host/client clock synchronization. Captures from the prior decode-complete
and worker-clock implementations retain those behaviors explicitly for exact replay. A cadence break ends
startup's unrestricted downward warmup instead of restarting it. No presentation
target is changed after preparation starts. The display-period startup clamp,
queue capacity, preset delay caps and release rates are unchanged. This can move
a genuinely late source phase later; it is not a zero-latency cure for unfinished
work and does not establish optical tear freedom. Vulkan's persistent native
modes and software safety floor remain unchanged.

`playout_offset_cadence_gate=0`, `playout_offset_slew_us_per_second=0`, and
`playout_offset_source_clock=0`
retain the historical observation and per-frame-slew path when absent from old
captures. New sessions capture all three switches and `playout_offset_maximum_step_us`.
See [offset-recovery investigation](docs/vrr-offset-recovery.md) for the supplied
trace evidence, implementation tradeoffs and pending validation. No build,
regression suite, exact replay or live A/B was run for this follow-up.

### Adaptive presentation permission (2026-09-15)

Active VRR now owns its native presentation policy instead of exposing a
separate `Allow tearing` preference. Loading preferences removes the retired
`allowvrrtearing` key so an old profile cannot silently disable adaptive
presentation. V-Sync remains the user-facing prerequisite for VRR; it does not
remove the allow-tearing capability that DXGI VRR requires.

On Windows DXGI, adaptive frames always use
`Present(0, DXGI_PRESENT_ALLOW_TEARING)`. Tight or unsafe slots retain the
controller's per-frame `Present(1, 0)` protection, so removing the preference
does not remove synchronized late-frame handling. The swapchain still requires
the allow-tearing capability. Existing enabled-policy calibration identities
remain stable.

On Linux Vulkan, the renderer always selects the qualified adaptive mode for
the surface: Mailbox on ordinary Wayland, Immediate on supported X11/KMSDRM or
Gamescope, and the existing Gamescope Mailbox/FIFO compatibility choices.
There is no longer a user-selected tear-free Mailbox/FIFO branch.

Schema-5 retains `session_allow_tearing` for capture compatibility. New live
sessions always record it as enabled. Replay still honors an explicit false
value from an older capture, treats an absent historical field as enabled, and
audits the native arguments of that recorded policy exactly.

### Retired oscillating latency test (removed 2026-09-11)

The temporary oscillation checkbox, saved preference, session plumbing and
worker timer have been removed. The selected latency preset stays fixed until
reconnect. Saving preferences removes `vrrlatencyoscillation` from older settings.
Trace columns `session_latency_oscillation` and `latency_test_phase` remain zero
for schema compatibility. The report tool retains historical phase parsing so
existing captures remain readable; historical oscillation reports are not exact
fixed-policy A/B evidence. Calibration follows the selected preset normally.

### Windows buffer regression investigation (2026-09-11)

The user-confirmed 4K/116 FPS Balanced session at 18:52:58 recorded 39 GPU-ready
event timeouts, followed by decoder recreation, approximately every ten seconds.
The newest completed connection is `Moonlight-vrr-20260911-185258-376.vrrtrace`
(259,093 bytes, SHA-256
`CA2D3824F96865F8F30BC7EACCE70BE70DA7ABBF636333875EEB28D4EF2C51B5`).
Its 858 arrivals pass exact replay before and after this correction. Its final
8.24 seconds contain no source intervals above 25 ms, but 11% of presented
interval pairs have jerk above 2 ms. Earlier connection fragments from this
same application run supply the timeout evidence; they are not mixed into the
newest connection's baseline metrics.

Two reproducible controller defects are corrected in responsive revision 2:
compensating source jitter no longer permanently disables smoothing, and early
readiness slack pays for an advanced deadline before acquiring extra reserve.
All three preset fixtures reduce average jerk from 8 ms to about 2.95 ms for
9/17 ms source pairs. Clean desktop transition bounds and recovery still pass.
The original final 8.24-second segment's candidate replay is unchanged because these defects
are not triggered there; it must not be cited as a measured gameplay improvement.

Windows now validates fence values between short event waits rather than
depending on one event notification for readiness. Deterministic missing-event,
stale-event, timeout and device-removal tests pass. A local GPU-copy probe passed
1,000 asynchronous fence completions, including 500 suppressed event waits.
The original single-event wait did not reproduce the periodic failure in that
standalone probe. A subsequent 64.94-second gameplay check
(`Moonlight-vrr-20260911-192230-869.vrrtrace`, SHA-256
`47D95A875F91A7023C0EAC938B3483E74D6DC724B3CBE049CA9CEB24A3C5325F`)
recorded no GPU-fence timeouts or decoder recreation; the user reported noticeably
better motion. Readiness was still 83.9%, with mean preparation 5.96 ms, including
5.48 ms in the render-ready wait. It lost arrival row 2 at startup (footer:
6,975 allocated, 6,974 recorded, one dropped); exact replay correctly fails on
frame 35. Do not treat this incomplete capture as strict A/B proof.

The follow-up Windows change implements the existing pre-schedule decode wait
using the frame's captured D2R fence. Previously Windows inherited the no-op
implementation, so asynchronous decode waiting was mixed into rendering service
and its predictor. The same bounded, fence-verified wait is used, without holding
the decode context lock. Monitored fences use the shared worker event as a wake
hint; non-monitored fences use short sleeps and completion polls. Failed waits
invalidate adaptive preparation and request recovery without advertising readiness.
The interface overload retains existing frame-based Linux readiness behavior.
New per-frame capture data must establish how much of the former render wait was
decode work; moving the boundary alone is not proof of lower total latency.
The follow-up app and diagnostics were rebuilt, all six deterministic suites
passed, fresh single-frame and warm-history fixtures passed exact replay, and
five fault scenarios passed their interval and latency assertions. The original
complete capture also retained exact historical replay. ChaseShare and its ZIP
were updated and hash-verified; the installed follow-up executable SHA-256 is
`0A52F9DAA1A2D4E77F125EABB86FFDAB4BF93D8F9AB816F38E5D180A36BF83DA`.
The deployed UNC replay executable passed its runtime help smoke test.

The subsequent 117.71-second capture,
`Moonlight-vrr-20260911-193700-084.vrrtrace` (3,740,216 bytes, last write
2026-09-12 00:39:09 UTC, SHA-256
`2AAF8DC583805162CC7A4D17E0958D40151CDE39BF80A4C78E66F5256919DB24`),
contains all 12,824 arrivals and 12,816 presentations. It records no fence
timeouts; the user confirmed the spikes were gone and motion was much smoother.
Mean GPU decode wait is 5.47 ms; preparation is 1.34 ms (0.91 ms render-fence
wait). Full decoder-output-to-submission latency is 12.67 ms mean / 16.91 ms p99.
Presented jerk is 6.045 ms p99, with 11.9% of pairs over 2 ms; sender-spacing
error is 4.402 ms p99. Three raw sender intervals exceed 25 ms. These remain
separate from client readiness and do not establish optical display smoothness.

The user identified the fluctuating overlay score as `Client ready on time`.
Its global value is 74.9%; the overlay combines the current and preceding
one-second windows and treats any preparation completion after the target as
late. Among 3,215 late presentations the median miss is 64 us, p95 663 us,
and p99 1,226 us. The buffer is held at its Balanced 8,621 us cap; this score's
variation is not evidence of oscillating buffer depth. Its strict deadline
definition is retained, and it must not be called a visual smoothness score.

This capture exposed two replay bugs: a startup idle estimate shifted one busy
frame despite unchanged submissions, and the timestamp audit confused GPU
readiness with immutable CPU output. The corrected replay caps the idle floor
by the row's own evidence, validates both timing boundaries and the explicit
decode wait, and measures latency from immutable output. All targets,
submissions, tear/raster classes, refresh phases and required controller fields
now reproduce exactly, with zero missing arrivals and exit code zero. The
original launcher sidecar retains the pre-correction failure; the fresh exact
result is `build/buffer-readiness-complete-baseline.json`.
Its verified share copy is `Moonlight-vrr-20260911-193700-084-replay-verified.json`.
Final replay SHA-256 is
`DCA1A60C6E88D31EE53AC8A3DAC79A483F437DDE6C2228267C98F214A184058F`;
the diagnostic executable and refreshed ZIP were republished and hash-verified.
Final session-policy comparison is identical to the capture; the five stress
scenarios pass with zero modeled interval violations and 16.91--18.41 ms p99
decoder-output-to-submission latency. No scenario is worker-saturated.

### Radeon 890M timeout diagnostics (2026-09-14)

The supplied `Downloads/Moonlight-1789408757.log` (65,618 bytes, SHA-256
`677B3D4A0DCF8B75649E52C360BB0B1E40E9501ED0658A341515F96E89669E72`)
records a present-ready timeout at target 16504, completed 16503, followed by
decoder recreation. Three decode queue overflows precede that timeout and ten
follow it during 00:10:30--00:10:40. No accompanying VRR capture was found in
Downloads. This report does not establish which GPU dependency stalled.

Failure logs now distinguish the elapsed deadline, iteration guard, reversed
clock, native wait failure and device removal, and include elapsed time and
wait-call count. Cross-device Signal/Wait failures include HRESULT and target.
Present-ready failures additionally report signal/flush/event-setup duration,
context-lock reacquisition duration, both device removal reasons, device/texture
mode, the frame's captured decode target, and both views of the shared fences.
Fence snapshots are sequential observations after reacquiring the presentation lock;
the next-signal counters may include newer decode work and are not the failing
frame's target. A zero captured target means no captured boundary is available.
The existing 50 ms budget, 100-wait guard, synchronization ordering, error
recovery and presentation policy are unchanged. These are diagnostic additions,
not a demonstrated correction for the reported GPU stall. A same-build comparison
with `D3D11VA_FORCE_SEPARATE_DEVICES=0` and deep tracing is still required to test
the shared-device/copy path against the separate-device/bind path.

### Production interval-quality queue (promoted from V2)

Every normal VRR session now selects revision 7 without an A/B setting. The queue
uses 0.5 ms tolerance for Low Latency and Balanced Target and 0.2 ms for Smooth;
explicit revision 8 retains its 250 us tolerance for historical replay. Preset
targets and severity weighting remain active.
Revision 7 retains revision 6's interval measurement and replaces its
binary score with severity-weighted quality tied to each latency preset.
Revision 6 superseded the revision-5 conditional-lateness measurement
described below. For consecutive submitted frames, intended spacing is the
difference in mapped source time plus deliberate Reduce judder adjustment.
The measured residual is `abs(submissionInterval - intendedInterval)`, including
zero-error intervals. Constant latency offsets cancel, and host cadence changes
are removed before scoring. Submission boundaries are a display-timing proxy,
not optical scanout confirmation. Discontinuous/missing frames break the pair;
their drops remain separately visible.

The controller and overlay share one one-second average (10 ms buckets). After
initial qualification (500 ms and 32 intervals), or one-second requalification
following a later sequence break, mean error through the selected profile tolerance
is accepted (0.5 ms for Low Latency/Balanced Target, 0.2 ms for Smooth). For each
evaluated interval, revision 7 computes
`loss = clamp(max(meanErrorUs - toleranceUs, 0) / intendedIntervalUs, 0, 1)`.
The shared score is `100 * (1 - sum(actualIntervalUs * loss) / sum(actualIntervalUs))`
over the selected preset's one/two/five-minute history, using 100 ms buckets.
Loss retains fractional microseconds rather than rounding every frame. Missing
coverage is unknown; before the selected history duration, the score uses the
available evaluated time. This is timing quality, not a percentage of perfect
frames or a perceptually calibrated score.
The same calculation serves all presets and both controller and overlay.

Low Latency / Balanced Target / Smooth seek 99% / 99.5% / 99.99%, respectively,
over one / two / five minutes.
An attack requires the preset-duration score below its target, current one-second loss
above the preset's allowed loss, and a fresh interval error over the selected
tolerance with
readiness-attributable lateness. It acquires only the current mean excess above
the preset allowance (`(1 - target) * intendedIntervalUs`), bounded by fresh
error above tolerance, the affected frame's lateness, 250 us per 250 ms, and
125 us applied per frame. The attributed frame must also be absorbable: its
decoder-queue time and complete serial service must each fit the actual intended
target interval. Serial service is the explicit decoder wait plus preparation
excluding acquisition plus render-scheduler delay, conservatively enlarged by a
deferred GPU-completion upper bound when one exists. This uses the target-to-
target interval after Reduce judder adjustment, rather than assuming the fitted
source period is always the available slot. Old score debt alone cannot authorize
buffer growth, and work that cannot fit a slot cannot be repaired by adding
standing delay.

Current above-target loss renews the protection hold and clears fractional
release credit. The long score still qualifies a future attack and remains the
reported preset-quality history, but an old below-target score does not renew the
live release hold after recent pressure clears. Smooth requires ten clean
seconds before release (increased from six after the latest gameplay report),
retaining its slower 50 us/second release speed. Low Latency and Balanced Target
hold for six/eight clean seconds. Low Latency retains 125 us per second; the
current policy raises Balanced from the `6bea92dd` baseline's 100 us per second
to the replay-selected 250 us per second knee. The longer holds still retain
protection between disturbances. The Balanced rate is a controller tradeoff, not
live visual proof. This adjustment
cannot improve a session already pinned at its buffer cap. The hold and release values
are serialized independently, so revision 7 captures retain their own settings.
The one-second detection window remains unchanged; quality uses the selected
one/two/five-minute history window. The overlay shows quality versus the selected target plus the current
one-second mean and selected tolerance. Historical revision 6 retains its binary proportion of evaluated
time within 500 us and its threshold-only buffer adaptation when selected through
explicit controller parameters. Explicit revision 8 retains its 250 us severity tolerance for historical compatibility; production sessions capture revision 7 and display the selected 0.50 ms or 0.20 ms tolerance. The regression report supports restoring the last user-confirmed smooth setting; the initial capture was a 417-row connection fragment. After normal application exit, the finalized latest capture contained 1,981 rows over 17.91 seconds, in Lowest latency mode, with applied buffer fixed at its 4,310 us cap and 26 playback drops. It does not demonstrate buffer oscillation or isolate tolerance as the cause of the reported motion regression.

The preference, Session presentation snapshot, decoder parameters, Pacer signature,
and VrrSessionConfig no longer carry a queue-arm flag. The existing
`|mean-miss-queue-v2` calibration suffix is retained unconditionally to preserve
previous V2 users' cache identity; its spelling is historical, not a selector.
The overlay reports smoothness and the preset target without V1/V2 arm labels.

During gameplay iteration, diagnostic validation was deferred at the user's
request. VRR16 release finalization now accepts revisions 6/7/8 in replay,
round-trips their captured parameters, and updates production capture assertions
to revision 7. Release CI runs the deterministic suites plus fresh single-frame
and warm-history exact-replay fixtures before packaging Windows diagnostics.
These are synthetic validation checks, not live A/B or optical latency evidence.

Historical revision-5 implementation and publication record (superseded):

Published to ChaseShare after the successful incremental app/diagnostic builds.
Application SHA-256: `E00649E8F5CD70E2AEA1C87F96D97D0CA413EB7CE03B1FE6ADEBF4C88223D62A`.
ZIP SHA-256: `12F1752A43A0DCCE2EA5CCCC74DE3A6744D185550465C2F8B494C6E9A129A220`.
Build/deploy/live copies and portable markers were checked. The user explicitly
requested skipping further tests until they say to finalize; no additional
replay, help smoke test or simulation was run after that instruction. The four
deterministic suites had already completed successfully before the interruption.
At that stage finalization and live A/B assessment were pending. The user has
since ended A/B selection; test and replay finalization remain separately deferred.

The former `V2 Queue` checkbox was persisted as `v2queue`, defaulted off, and was captured
once per stream through preferences, Session::PresentationSettings,
DECODER_PARAMETERS, Pacer::initialize, and VrrSessionConfig. Decoder recreation
retains that snapshot. Off resolves `playout_responsive_buffer=4`, preserving the
installed baseline; on resolves revision 5. Both use the same queue capacity,
decode/queue accounting, readiness clock correction, and preset buffer caps.
V2 calibration keys have a separate suffix, although cached history is diagnostic.

V2 uses actual preparation completion against the original deadline before
recovery clamps. It averages positive lateness among **late frames only** over
one second (10 ms buckets). On-time frames establish sample coverage but do not
enter that mean. A mean through 1000 us cannot request more buffering. Above
1000 us, a fresh late frame may request only the mean excess, capped at 250 us
per 250 ms, after at least 32 observations spanning 800 ms. The applied increase
is limited to 125 us per frame. Old samples alone cannot repeatedly request more
buffer. Discontinuities, source stalls, cancellation and sustained overload do
not supply clean adaptation evidence. Native presentation timing remains diagnostic.

V2 retains protection for 2/4/6 clean seconds and releases at 250/200/100 us per
second for Lowest/Balanced/Smoothest. These values are captured in
`playout_mean_miss_hold_us` and `playout_mean_miss_release_us_per_second`, so the
current preference cannot change exact historical replay. Silence does not
count as clean time. The existing 1 ms minimum, configured-frame caps and 16 ms
absolute ceiling remain in force.

The V2 overlay shows `Average miss (30s)` and a separate diagnostic smoothness
curve: `100 / (1 + (max(averageMissUs - 1000, 0) / 3000)^2)`. It is exactly 100
through a 1 ms average and continuous above it; it is not a measured probability
of visible smoothness. The 30-second score does not drive the one-second
controller. Client drops are reported separately and have no invented lateness.
The V1 overlay retains its historical on-time percentage/target and identifies
the selected queue arm explicitly.

User requested live gameplay A/B rather than simulated tuning. No candidate
sweep is used to select this experiment. Deterministic arithmetic/lifecycle tests
and exact diagnostic fixture checks validate implementation, not visual quality.
The earlier newest completed capture was
`\\allytwo\ChaseShare\vrr-traces\Moonlight-vrr-20260911-212200-077.vrrtrace`,
4,929,919 bytes, UTC last-write 2026-09-12 02:25:07, SHA-256
`8A65280D51E1489548A8785A28457B9C562F3D8EC6FFCD6C3BD4FEA80243BFD3`.
Fresh exact replay exited 3 on frame 10,737. Its footer records 16,255 arrivals,
16,253 enqueued rows and two dropped diagnostic rows; missing frame 10,736
prevents faithful reconstruction. Its matching launcher stderr records the same
failure. This capture is exploratory only, not A/B proof.

The tracer now uses a bounded MPSC ring instead of dropping a row whenever the
writer holds the handoff mutex. Producers publish completed row copies without
waiting for the writer. Capacity exhaustion or bounded producer contention still
drops diagnostics explicitly. Three-producer tests check 60,000 rows for intact
contents and per-producer ordering; shutdown drains in-flight publication.

### Historical baseline preset on-time targets and thresholded misses (2026-09-11)

Responsive revision 4 selects 99% / 99.5% / 99.95% readiness targets and
30 / 60 / 120-second learning windows for Lowest latency / Balanced / Smoothest.
The displayed outcome window is 30 seconds for every preset. Lateness through
1 ms is on time. Lateness over 1 ms through 2 ms becomes buffer pressure and an
outcome miss only when more than half of the live window exceeds 1 ms. Any
lateness over 2 ms and every client drop is a hard miss. The overlay continues
to expose lateness over 1 ms and 2 ms and a capacity indicator. Existing preset
caps and the 16 ms absolute ceiling still apply.

Revision 4 also fixes the readiness clock boundary. The worker used to replace
`decode_complete_us` with the wall clock after its GPU fence wait. If a decoded
frame had already waited in the pacing queue, that queue residence was therefore
reported as decode work. More buffer created more queue residence, which raised
the learned requirement and produced a positive feedback loop. The worker now
adds only the measured blocking fence wait to immutable `decoder_output_us`.
Transport queue age and the displayed queue-delay metric retain their separate
origins. Revision 3 and earlier keep their recorded behavior during replay.
That revision-4 arithmetic is historical in current source: production now
maps directly from decoder output and records a material wait's post-wait clock
only as a conservative readiness observation.

The exact capture used to prove the loop was
`C:\Users\Chase\vrr-traces\Moonlight-vrr-20260911-202703-700.vrrtrace`,
8,375,449 bytes, last write 2026-09-12 01:35:46 UTC, SHA-256
`D967B40BFD6676A52FE58F5FF0963572C71F9FC6DACBFFD1E849F60A492F2700`.
It contains 27,707 delivered frames with exact replay and complete sequence
integrity. In its last 30 seconds, strict accounting reported 96.79% on time;
only 39 of 3,210 outcomes were over 1 ms and 12 were over 2 ms. The old
readiness boundary included about 5.39 ms mean pacing-queue residence and drove
the applied buffer to its 16 ms ceiling. Reconstructing the boundary from
decoder output plus the measured fence wait removes that self-induced input.

The newest completed capture at final validation was
`C:\Users\Chase\vrr-traces\Moonlight-vrr-20260911-210959-966.vrrtrace`,
7,698,997 bytes, last write 2026-09-12 02:14:45 UTC, SHA-256
`9304641A0A24251DAA71B94373E23FEEEA6173F6BAEB80A878D0371FCA8B4214`.
Its exact replay exits 3 on frame 13,134 and the launcher produced no successful
sidecar, so it remains exploratory. Historical compatibility was instead gated
against the exact 27,707-frame capture named above. The four required
deterministic suites and replay help pass with the final diagnostic build, both
fresh schema-5 revision-4 fixtures pass exact replay with complete sequences,
and all five fault scenarios pass interval and latency assertions without worker
saturation. Gameplay validation is pending.

### Historical per-frame Gamescope repaint experiment (retired 2026-09-10)

The retired Linux checkbox **Test Gamescope repaint after each frame**
(`gamescoperepaint`, default off) is snapshotted into decoder parameters on
connection. With `GAMESCOPE_WAYLAND_DISPLAY` present, Vulkan creates a private
Wayland connection on a helper thread. Successful adaptive and legacy video
submissions enqueue `debug_force_repaint`; cancelled/failed submissions do not.
The render thread only sets a coalesced atomic notification and writes a
nonblocking eventfd. It never runs a process or waits for a compositor reply.

The helper keeps one command outstanding and one pending notification. Slow
replies coalesce requests; discovery/acknowledgement timeout, protocol rejection,
or disconnect disables the helper for the stream with a warning. Teardown wakes
and joins the helper without a Wayland roundtrip. Logged acknowledgements prove
command execution, not scanout or motion improvement. This private version-1
protocol is experimental and may change with Gamescope.

This command sets Gamescope's base repaint flag, not its non-base-plane overlay
flag; it cannot bypass an in-flight flip or reproduce all Steam overlay policy.
The user reports forced composition did not fix the symptom. Per-frame repaint
was a separate experiment; its user-facing control is now removed and no visual remedy is established. Keep the
forced-composition checkbox off when testing this path to avoid its independent
startup validation failure. No fixed-rate timer or extra image submission is used.

Historical update on 2026-09-09, based on `b60fa11a`: Windows VRR automatically used
the composition presentation API on Windows 11 build 22000.194 or newer when
the driver supports independent flip. Present IDs and independent-flip display
events provide native feedback. Unsupported systems retain DXGI presentation.
Submission intervals supply the production client-cadence estimate regardless
of display-event availability. Native display events remain separate tracking
evidence and DXGI refresh references remain excluded from verified measurements.
No checkbox is needed.
The helper adds no refresh wait or future-frame target; actual Ally latency,
VRR behavior, HDR, and fullscreen transitions still need hardware validation.

Current Windows presenter policy, updated on 2026-09-09 after `a5500a26`:
VRR defaults to the DXGI swapchain so the per-frame latch decision actually
selects synchronized or tearing-permitted presentation. Composition's native
ordering does not implement that switch; the 22:27 capture used composition
for all 12,799 submissions despite 2,654 logical latch transitions. This is a
renderer contract mismatch, not evidence that changing latch hysteresis will
remove the reported judder. `MOONLIGHT_VRR_COMPOSITION=1` opts into the existing
composition backend for diagnostic comparison, snapshotted at renderer setup.
DXGI retains submission-estimate cadence diagnostics; its refresh
references are not verified frame display events. Calibration identities now
include the active presenter so their readiness histories cannot cross-seed.
The capture lost one row and failed exact replay. Exploratory replay favored
retaining the current per-frame controller over rate protection or adaptive-only
spacing, but cannot model a change of native backend or prove a visual remedy.
A fresh gameplay capture is required for that comparison.

Current VRR timing choices (introduced after `20fa2bc4`, allowances updated
2026-09-18): the `VRR timing`
selector offers Low Latency, Balanced Target, and Smooth throughout the VRR
frame-rate range. `vrrlatencymode` persists IDs 2, 1, and 0 respectively.
Balanced Target is the new-user default. A saved mode takes precedence;
otherwise an existing `vrrlatencyfix=true` migrates to Balanced Target and
`false` to Smooth.
The selection is snapshotted through session, decoder, and pacer setup, so
reconnect after changing it. Fixed-refresh pacing is independent of this setting.

| Timing choice | Adaptive playout-buffer cap | Stale-work allowance with a successor |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Low Latency (2) | One fitted source period | One fitted source period |
| Balanced Target (1, default) | Two fitted source periods | Two fitted source periods |
| Smooth (0) | Four fitted source periods | Two fitted source periods |

Low Latency and Balanced Target are capped at 16 ms; Smooth is capped at
24 ms. Production sets
`playout_delay_maximum_period_per_mille=0`: a slow desktop source must not
expand the absolute maximum. Historical captures retain their recorded
period multiplier for replay.
The allowance bounds extra padding, not total latency or native queue depth.
Source-clock mapping, rendering/readiness learning, per-frame latch decisions,
and applicable display-spacing safeguards remain active in every choice.
Consistent padding reserves time for uneven delivery or preparation so a late
frame can still reach its intended slot. Less padding offers faster response
but can expose more late or skipped frames; more padding can absorb more of
that variation. It does not regularize game-driven frame intervals. Stable
delivery may look the same across choices, and no universal percentage of lost
smoothness follows from the selected allowance.

With `playout_responsive_buffer` enabled, live sessions set
`playout_delay_cap_uses_observed_period=1`, so preset caps follow the fitted
source period. A desktop transition from 120 to 19 or 30 FPS cannot expand the
absolute ceiling, although the source-relative allowance follows the fitted
period until another cap binds. A source that delivers below its nominal rate is
not silently clipped to the nominal preset period. The zero default retains the configured
stream-rate cap for historical replay. `VrrSessionConfig::latencyMode` resolves
the buffer cap into the trace/replay parameter
`playout_delay_cap_source_period_per_mille`: 2000 for Low Latency and
Balanced Target, and 4000 for Smooth. Earlier captures retain their recorded
ratios (including vrr17's 500/1000/3000). A zero schema default means an older
capture has no source-relative cap and retains its recorded behavior. The
historical `latency_fix_enabled`, `latency_fix_all_rates`, and
`latency_fix_delay_period_per_mille` fields remain recorded so old captures
replay exactly and Balanced Target/Low Latency retain their admission-age policy. The
internal session mode defaults to zero for historical tests and replay,
independently of the UI's Balanced Target default. Balanced Target and Low Latency append
`|latency-mode=1` or `|latency-mode=2` before calibration-key hashing, while
Smooth retains the ordinary key.

`VrrFrameDropPolicy` supplies the worker's discard checks. The all-arrival queue
simulation shares the later checks but does not model early queue pruning or
counterfactual decode waits. Every non-metronome profile permits replacing work older than two
fitted source periods when a newer queued successor exists. One period is
ordinary occupancy for a single worker waiting on the preceding frame and is
not a stale condition. In the lower-latency profiles age starts at pacer
admission. The worker subtracts the current frame's explicit decode wait only
for discard eligibility, preserving all pre-wait queue residence and subsequent
scheduler delay. A newly ready image must not expire merely because GPU service
took longer than the age cutoff: a newer queued image need not be ready. Age is
checked again after waiting to render, before spending GPU work. Smooth retains the
target-relative second check. The sole available frame is never discarded by
this policy. Local skips preserve the source clock and last submission. These
choices do not impose an FPS cap or change the native presenter.

Historical Latency fix checkbox (after `db596431`): `vrrlatencyfix` defaulted
off and applied the half-display-period allowance only near the refresh ceiling.
`VrrSessionConfig::latencyFix` remains for old tests and captures. With
`latency_fix_all_rates=0`, the fitted cadence still enters at the shared
near-refresh cutoff (116 FPS at 120 Hz) and exits below 114 FPS. Rejected excess
demand is clipped on exit so a near-ceiling miss cannot reappear as padding
solely because the cadence leaves that band; fresh lower-rate misses can acquire
ordinary protection. Historical enabled profiles used `|latency-fix=1`.

Native display cadence remains diagnostic. Windows and Linux use the shared
readiness-attributed submission-interval error policy for buffer growth
(section 9.2); these are submission estimates, not confirmed scanout measurements.

[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) owns machine-specific build, deployment, and capture
procedures. This document owns the architecture explanation. Keep both current
when changing their respective contracts.

Updated on 2026-09-09 after `5e759232`: the precise interrupt clock is resolved
through the realtime API set. On this machine kernel32 has no direct export,
which falsely rejected composition despite driver support. Hidden-window setup
now succeeds for both 8-bit and 10-bit presentation buffers. Production restores
per-frame native protection (`playout_adaptive_only=0`, `playout_per_frame_latch=1`)
to avoid accumulating a display-period-plus-guard delay at 120 FPS / 120 Hz.
Composition can honor protected slots through its native ordering, so it now
advertises that capability as DXGI does. Hardware setup is verified; gameplay
display-event coverage and physical presentation still require a fresh session.

The follow-up black-screen correction explicitly sets the presentation surface's
source rectangle to the allocated buffer dimensions in `resize()`, including
initial setup. A successful `SetBuffer`/`Present` did not establish that area:
the unconfigured surface produced no composition or independent-flip events.
The on-screen probe reproduced zero events before the correction and hundreds
of composition events afterward; a screen capture confirms its image is visible.
Independent-flip coverage remains unverified in this desktop/overlay environment.
The hidden `--check` validates initialization only and cannot gate visible output.

The subsequent timing correction replaces the interrupt-clock reference with
QPC scaled to 100 ns using `QueryPerformanceFrequency`. Raw independent-flip
events were present, but their timestamps were rejected as future because the
interrupt-clock epoch was about 20 ms behind QPC on this machine. The old
independent-frame counter counted only accepted timestamps, concealing the cause.
Both target time and feedback now use the same QPC-derived domain; every feedback
sample is freshly correlated to the worker clock. No fixed offset is applied.
Diagnostics count raw independent events separately from rejected timestamps.
A hardware probe with this correction measured 464 of 465 steady-state submissions
and 3.85 ms p99 submission-to-display latency at 116 FPS / 120 Hz. This is native
OS evidence, not optical validation or a full gameplay latency measurement.

Linux AMD decode policy, 2026-09-10: before Qt/SDL can initialize a graphics
screen, `main()` appends `lowlatencydec` to process-local `AMD_DEBUG` when VAAPI
support is built. Existing flags are preserved (including the `R600_DEBUG`
fallback when `AMD_DEBUG` is unset). `MOONLIGHT_AMD_LOW_LATENCY_DECODE=0` disables
the automatic addition for diagnosis; it does not erase flags supplied by the
user. The local moonlight-dev wrapper forwards those variables into Distrobox.
This requests Mesa's separate hardware decode policy; FFmpeg `LOW_DELAY` was
already set and is not equivalent. Mesa 26.1.7's installed RadeonSI library
contains the option, and matching source propagates it to the VCN decode
message. Other vendors do not use this AMD option. Older drivers may ignore it.
No fence wait is removed or shortened, no global power state is changed, and
acceptance/effect by the device firmware is not confirmed by a startup log.
It may use more power; live benefit remains to be measured.

## 1. Fundamental model

Moonlight is the client. The host captures and encodes video, sends compressed
frames, and receives input. The client receives and repairs packets, assembles
compressed frames, decodes them, renders the resulting image, and submits it for
display. Audio and input have their own queues and timing paths.

VRR changes the scheduling and presentation of decoded video. It cannot create
a missing host frame, reverse network loss, or remove the time already spent
capturing, encoding, transporting, and decoding. It can absorb some variability
by delaying frames to a more regular schedule. That costs latency, so the
implementation constrains both the frame queue and the learned delay.

```text
Host capture / encode                           [outside this client]
    |
    | UDP video: RTP timestamp + NV frame/packet identity + FEC
    v
VideoReceiveThreadProc -> RtpvAddPacket -> processRtpPayload
    | packet ordering, repair, access-unit assembly, recovery
    v
Bounded compressed-frame queue
    |
    v
FFDecoder thread: pull decode unit -> avcodec_send_packet
    |                            -> avcodec_receive_frame
    | AVFrame + retained identity/timing metadata + decode GPU boundary
    v
Pacer selection
    +-- legacy queues / V-sync source / renderer
    |
    +-- VrrPacingWorker: bounded decoded-frame queue
          -> establish the backend decode dependency; record any CPU wait
          -> controller computes source slot, target, render-start deadline
          -> discard stale work when a newer frame is available
          -> wait for render start
          -> prepare GPU rendering and establish completion/ownership state
          -> release only a source the presenter marks reusable
          -> wait for target and applicable submission floor
          -> recheck lifecycle -> verify deferred readiness -> presentAdaptive
          -> submission/native feedback -> future controller decisions
          -> retire deferred source ownership only at a safe backend boundary
          -> asynchronous trace writer

Audio UDP -> audio RTP queue -> Opus -> audio-device queue
SDL input events -> input queue / sender -> host
```

Keep these separate: intended source slot, scheduled CPU submission, GPU
readiness, actual native call, OS presentation feedback, and physical scanout.
They are related observations, not interchangeable timestamps.

## 2. Source map and reading order

the live path records and which parts replay holds fixed.

## 3. Settings, negotiation, and mode selection

### 3.1 Preferences are not proof of an active mode

`StreamingPreferences` persists ordinary settings through `QSettings`.
At the inspected revision, V-sync defaults on and VRR defaults off. The VRR
timing selector defaults to Balanced Target for new users, with the saved-checkbox
migration described above. Reduce judder defaults on, preserves the saved
`smoothvrrframetiming` choice, and enables the moderate cadence smoother below.
Legacy frame pacing defaults off. The default requested stream is 720p60.
These are defaults, not evidence of the user's current saved settings.

The FPS picker is advisory. Fixed 30 and 60 FPS remain available. When V-sync
and VRR are requested, usable display refresh rates contribute VRR choices at
`floor(refresh - refresh^2 / 3600)` and Low-latency VRR choices at
`floor(refresh / 6) * 5`, restoring the original dropdown calculations
(116 and 100 FPS at 120 Hz; 138 and 120 FPS at 144 Hz). Native rates remain
available as ordinary choices with VRR enabled or disabled. Native choices take
precedence when another display's calculated recommendation matches them, and
a saved maximum-refresh selection stays selected when VRR is toggled.
A saved custom FPS remains selectable. Toggling VRR does not rewrite saved FPS;
`m_StreamConfig.fps` receives the requested preference.

`snapshotPresentationSettings()` resolves that request for the session:

1. Query the actual window display refresh. An unavailable refresh may fall
   back to 60 Hz for legacy behavior, but that fallback cannot qualify VRR.
2. Resolve effective V-sync. A requested FPS over refresh plus 5 disables it.
3. Require readable refresh, effective V-sync, and stream FPS no greater than
   display refresh for VRR.
4. Force effective borderless desktop fullscreen when VRR is accepted, keeping
   the saved window preference intact.
5. If VRR was requested but rejected and effective V-sync remains enabled,
   enable fixed pacing even if the separate legacy pacing checkbox is off.

The renderer must subsequently support the mode. The Pacer constructs
`VrrSessionConfig`, fixes `allowAdditionalQueuedFrame=false`, passes smoothing
settings, checks presenter support, and starts the worker.
Unsupported presentation or failed worker initialization falls back to the
legacy path. A UI checkbox alone cannot establish DXGI capability, active
adaptive presentation, or that the physical panel is varying refresh.

`tracevrrframes` defaults to false. The Settings checkbox enables diagnostic
frame tracing only, with export of the latest completed recording and a button
to open `Desktop/vrr-diagnostics`. The platform's Desktop location is resolved
through Qt, rather than hardcoding an English profile path. The session owns its
environment wrapper after acquiring the active-session semaphore, restoring it
only after decoder shutdown
and logger drain. Existing external trace launchers take precedence. Recording is
fixed for the stream, including decoder recreation; full UI/file/lifecycle
contracts are in [diagnostics](docs/vrr-diagnostics.md).

### 3.2 Host frame-limiter discovery

Vibeshine advertises optional `/serverinfo` fields `FrameLimiterSupported`,
`FrameLimiterEnabled`, `VirtualDisplayFrameLimiterEnabled` (integer booleans),
and
`FrameLimiterFpsLimitMilliHz` (zero follows stream FPS). The protocol is
brand-independent and can also be implemented by Vibepollo. Missing flags
mean no advertised integration; capabilities are ephemeral and refreshed on
host polling, including clearing them after downgrading a host.

`FrameLimiterEnabled` reports limiting for the configured host display path:
either the manual limiter is enabled with an applicable provider, or virtual
display mode is selected and automatic virtual-display limiting is enabled.
Windows does not require the manual checkbox for the automatic path. Linux
also requires a selected Linux limiter provider. The separate virtual-display
flag reports automatic policy availability, not activation on physical outputs.
These are configuration reports, not per-game proof of provider availability,
successful application, or app/client display overrides.

The game list no longer displays a frame-limiter warning. Capability discovery
remains available internally. Settings describe full-refresh streaming and the
optional lower-rate VRR choices without requiring a host limiter.

### 3.3 What the host is told

Session setup fills `STREAM_CONFIGURATION` with FPS, dimensions, bitrate,
colorspace/range, encryption, codec capabilities, and other connection choices.
`clientRefreshRateX100` is a refresh hint in Hz times 100; SDP emits it as
`x-nv-video[0].clientRefreshRateX100`. RTSP negotiation determines the actual
codec/profile using host SDP and server codec flags, with AV1/HEVC/H.264 paths.
Renderer setup receives that negotiated format before video streaming starts.

Intra Refresh negotiation (2026-09-23, based on `eefde52f`) is owned by the
parent repository's `moonlight-common-c/SdpGeneratorExtensions.c`. The qmake
target compiles this wrapper instead of the submodule's `SdpGenerator.c`;
the wrapper includes that unchanged source with only its entry point renamed.
It adds `x-ss-video[0].intraRefresh:1` to the generated attribute block for
Sunshine protocol versions at least 7.1.350 when the decoder advertises
reference-frame recovery for the actual negotiated codec. Other cases return
the original payload unchanged. The existing RTSP path handles the updated
length and encryption. There are no submodule edits or public callback changes.
This is a capability request, not confirmation that the host encoder enabled
Intra Refresh. The wrapper relies on common-c's internal generator contract;
its SDP regression test must pass when updating the submodule.

Packet size is aligned down to a 16-byte multiple for FEC. Connection setup
also applies route-dependent packet-size limits. These are transport decisions,
not VRR scheduling parameters.

When VRR presentation qualifies for the session
(`m_PresentationSettings.enableVrr`, decided before launch), `NvHTTP::startApp`
adds `clientVrrRequested=1` to the launch/resume query. Hosts that do not know
it ignore it. Vibeshine uses it for a low-latency WGC buffer and, in its
Automatic virtual-display capture mode (`vibe-test` 09b09ae8), holds the
virtual display at 1000 Hz. WGC stamps frames at DWM composition, which lands
on the virtual display's refresh grid; a 4x display at 116 FPS put every RTP
timestamp on a 2.156 ms grid (capture 20260922-195738 deep trace), while 1000 Hz
bounds that to 1 ms. Vibeshine also refines stamps from the game's DXGI Present
events at send time. This is host behavior the client only requests.

The client source proves which values it sends and how it interprets the
response. It does not prove how a particular Sunshine/GFE version captures,
timestamps, paces, or encodes in response. A refresh hint is not host/client
clock synchronization.

## 4. Packet ingress, frame assembly, and recovery

The video receive thread reads UDP into staging buffers, optionally decrypts
AES-GCM payloads, converts network-order RTP fields, and transfers packets to
`RtpvAddPacket()`. Video packets contain RTP sequence/timestamp identity plus
an NV header with stream packet index, frame index, SOF/EOF/picture-data flags,
and FEC metadata. RTP timestamps are in a 90 kHz domain.

The socket receive buffer accommodates roughly 2048 packets to absorb bursts.
Connection watchdogs detect prolonged absence of traffic or successful frames.
The receive path is not a frame scheduler: it should advance valid compressed
data without intentional presentation waiting.

`RtpVideoQueue` groups by frame and FEC block, tracks ordering and missing data,
and uses Reed-Solomon parity to recover losses when possible. Completed data
packets are delivered in order to the depacketizer. Unrecoverable gaps advance
recovery and notify the host. FEC status and frame-loss control messages should
not be described as individual RTP packet retransmission.

One frame's first receive time is reused for its packets. That gives a stable
assembly-duration boundary without taking a clock sample for every packet.
`processRtpPayload()` validates stream continuity, strips headers, identifies
frame boundaries/types, and assembles codec access units. H.264/HEVC Annex-B
NAL units become a linked buffer chain; IDR setup includes codec parameter sets.
AV1 follows its appropriate picture-data assembly path.

The resulting `DECODE_UNIT` owns the compressed buffer chain and carries
frame identity and timing metadata. Non-direct operation uses a bounded queue
of 15 decode units. Queue overflow flushes queued compressed frames and requests
IDR recovery, rather than allowing latency to grow without bound. Direct-submit
renderers can instead submit on the receive/depacketizer path, but the production
FFmpeg decoder advertises pull-renderer capability and owns its decoder thread.

Loss recovery respects codec dependencies. Dropping an arbitrary compressed
reference frame is different from discarding an already-decoded presentation
frame. Invalid packet continuity can drop the current frame and trigger IDR or
reference-frame invalidation recovery depending on capabilities. Repeated drops
eventually force IDR recovery; the inspected code has a 120-consecutive-drop
threshold. `requestDecoderRefresh()` flushes pending units and defers assembly
state reset to a suitable boundary. Completion releases the compressed buffers;
successful IDR completion establishes valid reference state.

## 5. Clock domains and latency boundaries

| Value | Domain / units | Meaning and limitation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RTP timestamp | Host-origin 90 kHz counter | Source timing identity; wraps and must be unwrapped. Not a client wall-clock timestamp. |
| `presentationTimeUs` | Relative source presentation time, microseconds | Normally derived from RTP. Missing Sunshine PTS can use elapsed local receive time as fallback. |
| `receiveTimeUs` | Client monotonic microseconds | First packet arrival for the frame. Not host capture time. |
| `enqueueTimeUs` / reassembled time | Client monotonic microseconds | Complete compressed frame assembled/queued. |
| `decodeSubmitUs` | Client monotonic microseconds | Sampled immediately before FFmpeg packet submission. |
| `decoderOutputUs` | Client monotonic microseconds | Immutable timestamp captured immediately when FFmpeg returns the decoded frame; client-processing reporting origin. |
| `decodeCompleteUs` | Client monotonic microseconds | Post-output readiness observation; anchors production RTP-to-client mapping so hardware decode duration is absorbed in the sender offset. Linux samples it after `vaSyncSurface()`, Windows after the monitored decode-to-render fence wait. Without a wait over 200 us it equals `decoderOutputUs`, as on Windows before 2026-09-22 and on shared-device or non-monitored-fence sessions. |
| `decodeSyncWaitUs` | Elapsed client microseconds | Explicit CPU time spent by the worker on a decoder/backend completion primitive. It is serial service and latency accounting, not a source-clock timestamp. A zero value does not exclude a GPU-queued dependency. |
| Worker queue, decision, preparation, wait, submission times | Client monotonic microseconds | Distinct CPU-side lifecycle boundaries. |
| Shared fence values | GPU ordering identities | Establish dependencies/completion; not elapsed time by themselves. |
| Native DXGI QPC fields | QPC ticks plus frequency/correlation | OS timing evidence requiring identity and clock mapping. |
| Host processing latency | 1/10 millisecond units | Host-reported aggregate when present; zero means unavailable/inapplicable. |
| Audio samples | Audio stream/device cadence | Independent of video target scheduling. |
| `Reserve` internal time | Nanoseconds | Convert explicitly at the controller/model boundary. |

`LiGetMicroseconds()` calls the common platform clock. On Windows that is elapsed
QPC time from an opaque local epoch. Decoder and pacer timestamps therefore share
a monotonic domain. They are not automatically synchronized to host, GPU, audio
hardware, or panel clocks.

Useful differences are:

```text
assembly       = enqueueTimeUs       - receiveTimeUs
pre-submit     = decodeSubmitUs      - enqueueTimeUs
decode         = decoderOutputUs     - decodeSubmitUs
post-decode    = submissionTimeUs    - decoderOutputUs
client ingress = submissionTimeUs    - receiveTimeUs
client processing = presentationCallEndUs - decoderOutputUs
rendering         = preparationDurationUs + presentationCallDurationUs
queue/pacing      = client processing - rendering - explicitDecodeSyncWait
```

Check validity and ordering before subtracting. Post-decode includes queueing,
GPU dependencies, rendering/preparation, scheduler delays, deliberate pacing,
and native submission behavior. It is not simply the configured playout delay.
The performance overlay retains frame queue delay and rendering
time, without a separate client-processing row. These use the current queue/pacing
and rendering quantities for successfully presented frames, with one shared frame count.
Queue/pacing excludes the explicit worker GPU decode wait. In advanced tracing,
the two components plus the separate GPU decode synchronization line partition client processing.
Queue/pacing includes queue residence, target waits and other time outside
preparation, presentation and explicit decode synchronization. “Client processing
delay” ends when the presentation call returns. It does not include unmeasured
time from that return until the image becomes visible on the display.
On Windows with monitored fences, the worker waits for the decode fence before
scheduling, and that wait is the GPU decode synchronization line, as on Linux. The
GPU-side decode-to-render wait remains queued. The residual present-ready fence
wait occurs inside the presentation call and is not a decode-wait row.
Linux VAAPI/Vulkan Mailbox output is asynchronous and
does not report a CPU output-completion sample; other Linux imports still poll
before the target hold. These accounting identities therefore partition the
observed CPU path; they do not expose every GPU stage.
None of these differences alone measures click-to-photon or glass-to-glass
latency. RTT is a round trip, not measured one-way video delay.

The controller keeps source periods in Q16 fixed point where needed. Do not
collapse that to rounded milliseconds when reasoning about long-run drift.
RTP-to-microsecond conversion and epoch/wrap handling must be followed at the
specific use site; a converted RTP number still needs a client-clock mapping.

## 6. Decoder ownership and renderer handoff

The production FFmpeg decoder starts a dedicated `FFDecoder` thread after
renderer setup. It waits through `LiWaitForNextVideoFrame()` when no packets are
outstanding and interleaves pulling compressed input with draining FFmpeg output
when work is in flight. “Pull decoder” describes ownership of the common-library
queue; FFmpeg still uses `avcodec_send_packet()` and `avcodec_receive_frame()`.
Individual FFmpeg codecs may execute more work at either call.

`submitDecodeUnit()` requires a suitable initial IDR, tracks frame-number gaps,
copies the `LENTRY` chain into the reusable packet buffer, and sends the packet.
After successful submission it retains a metadata copy and submission timestamp
in matching queues. The original compressed payload pointers become invalid
after completion and must not be retained as frame storage.

For each output `AVFrame`, the decoder associates queued metadata with that
output, stamps decode completion, and copies frame number, RTP identity,
receive/reassembly time, and decode-submit time into the VRR frame record.
Legacy rendering uses `frame->pts` for source timing and a local `pkt_dts` handoff
timestamp for queue measurements. Those fields should not be substituted for
the explicit VRR timing fields.

`ffGetFormat()` selects the pixel format expected by the chosen renderer and
refuses an incompatible ordinary FFmpeg fallback. Windows has DXVA2 and D3D11VA
paths; software output and other platforms use their corresponding renderers.
Hardware decode can keep image data on the GPU. An `AVFrame` being available
does not by itself mean every GPU read/write dependency has completed.

`Session::drSubmitDecodeUnit()` also protects decoder lifetime with a try-lock:
decoder destruction has main-thread/API constraints, and units can be ignored
while that lock is held, with refresh recovery after recreation. The FFmpeg
pull path is the important steady-state path for this fork.

Legacy Pacer queues drop old frames at their bounds and move frames according
to the V-sync/render path. They defer freeing a rendered frame to protect GPU
use. VRR replaces that pacing mechanism with its worker and explicit presenter
contract; it does not replace network assembly or codec reference handling.

## 7. VRR worker: queue, execution, and lifecycle

### 7.1 Queue ownership and backpressure

The VRR queue admits three waiting frames plus one active frame; the Smooth
profile admits four (`playout_queue_frames`, 0 = the historical three in older
captures). The same count sets the delay budget in `playoutQueueLimitUs()`:
waiting frames x period, minus render lead and the full Reduce judder retiming
budget. With three frames at 116 FPS that budget was ~16.9 ms once the retiming
cap rose to 6 ms, so Smooth's 24 ms ceiling was unreachable and live overlays
showed "limit 16.86 ms" (capture 20260922-221707). The decoder pool reserves
the extra surface (`extra_hw_frames` = classic pacer outstanding frames +
`VrrLargestQueuedFrames` - `VrrMaximumQueuedFrames`). This is a
decoded-frame queue, separate from the 15-unit compressed queue and native
swapchain buffers. Do not add these counts and treat the result as a fixed
latency: the queues have different owners, lifetimes, and service rates.
Backend-held source references can outlive the active worker step without
increasing decoded-frame admission. Their limits protect decoder-surface lifetime,
not a target amount of playout buffering.

At `submit()`, the presenter captures the decode boundary before subsequent
decoder GPU work can be queued. Under the queue mutex, stopped/suspended workers
reject frames; a full queue evicts the oldest waiting frame, marks a discontinuity,
and admits the new frame. Trace/counter work occurs outside the queue lock.

The worker also sheds stale work when a fresher queued successor exists and
age/backlog/missed-tick criteria apply. All non-metronome profiles use a
two-source-period age allowance. Balanced Target and Low Latency measure it from
pacer admission, while Smooth uses the scheduled target for its second
check. A lone late frame may still be shown.
This differs from throwing away compressed reference frames and does not require
resetting the codec merely because an image was not presented.

### 7.2 One normal frame

1. Wake and consume pending window notifications. Before dequeuing for a blocking
   decode wait, reject expired queue fronts only while a newer adjacent source
   frame exists. Use two periods of the larger of fitted cadence and successor
   RTP spacing (four for historical metronome); skip this check on pending rebase
   or discontinuous stamps. Record `queue_stale` without a controller decision.
   The sole image remains eligible. Then dequeue the retained frame.
2. Check stop/suspend state and establish this frame's decode dependency. Record
   any explicit CPU wait as serial service. Production at `18602b1c` maps from
   decode completion; immutable `decoderOutputUs` remains the full-latency
   origin. Historical captured parameters can instead select decoder output.
3. Ask `VrrTimingController::schedule()` for the target, render-start deadline,
   latch request, and diagnostics using the current monotonic time.
4. Apply stale replacement policy when newer work is available.
5. Wait until render start, then recheck window/display epoch and lifecycle.
6. Call the presenter's `prepareFrame()` with the captured decode dependency
   and the selected `VrrPresentRequest`. Mode changes, rendering, and image
   acquisition belong inside this measured preparation interval; intentional
   target waiting does not. D3D11 keeps its mode selection at Present; Linux
   Vulkan keeps the swapchain's startup-selected mode.
7. If preparation supplies a completed renderer wait, feed that measured interval
   into the controller's bounded readiness history. A presenter may instead
   report completion after the target hold, or leave it unavailable. Future
   frames may start rendering earlier by an available learned lead; the source
   target and native latch decision are unchanged. Failed waits and incomplete
   timing are not training samples. The worker removes an explicit preparation-
   time GPU wait from the generic learned preparation cost so one stall cannot
   inflate both budgets.
8. Handle preparation failure/cancellation. If the presenter reports
   `sourceFrameReusable`, release the decoder surface before the target wait.
9. Wait for the target, then enforce the controller's currently applicable
   earliest-submission floor with another clock read and wait if necessary.
10. Consume final lifecycle notifications immediately before the native operation.
11. Call `presentAdaptive()`, capture result and timing, and consume any deferred
   completion result before recording submission. A deferred completion can
   train future readiness lead and bound current serial service; it cannot alter
   the target already issued for this frame.
12. Trace the outcome and retain/defer frame ownership as required by the presenter.
   Backend source retirement may continue after this worker step.

With `MOONLIGHT_VRR_OFFSCREEN_PREPARATION=1` on Linux VAAPI/Mailbox,
after the first ordinary frame establishes the real
swapchain format, admitted frames also receive cancellable preparation tickets.
A separate thread performs decode synchronization, source import, rendering
to an offscreen texture, and output-completion polling. It owns its own
libplacebo renderer and mapping textures; it never acquires a swapchain image.
The pacing thread waits for the ticket before scheduling, then acquires the
swapchain, copies the completed output, verifies that short copy has completed,
and applies the ordinary target wait. Only after the copy does preparation of
the next image proceed, preventing its GPU work from delaying that copy.

The 2026-09-21 freeze correction is based on `abd6b82d`. A completed
preparation ticket bypasses the two pre-render stale-replacement checks:
rendering has already finished, and a newer queued source is not evidence of
a ready replacement. Queue capacity and expiry still shed waiting work, and
shutdown, suspension and output-epoch checks still cancel active work. This
prevents a render/drop loop under sustained GPU load without altering source
timestamps or hiding preparation latency. The completed live capture
`20260921-002333-70409` reproduced exactly and contained only two presentations
in 45.8 seconds, with 2,528 completed staged images rejected as stale. This was
presentation starvation rather than a mutex deadlock. A worker regression
exercises repeated 40 ms preparation with newer queued images in all three
latency modes. It fails before the correction and passes afterward; all eleven
VRR/backend/profile/GPU trace suites, replay help, native startup and the latest
capture's exact replay check pass. Evidence is in `build/freeze-fix-validation/`.
Actual GPU throughput and visible recovery still need a live retest.

The subsequent `20260921-004719-85692` session log reported 54.17 and 31.90
rendered FPS for its two 3840x2160 streams, despite 105.36 and 107.74 incoming
FPS. Offscreen preparation introduces an extra target copy and CPU-observed
completion waits before allowing the next preparation job. It is now opt-in;
the default once again renders directly into the swapchain and retains the
mapped source until GPU reads retire, using the presentation semaphore for
completion. This removes the new staging cost; recovered 4K throughput still
requires live verification. The completed-ticket starvation correction remains
in place for experimental use.

Tickets refer to the existing three waiting admissions plus the active image;
they do not add another playout queue. Eviction and lifecycle discard cancel
the corresponding ticket. The preparation queue is independently bounded to
three pending jobs and one running job. Completed textures are reused. A
cancelled job that already submitted GPU work retains its source mapping until
the output completes; a timeout/error drains outstanding GPU work before
unmapping. Shutdown interrupts ticket waits and joins preparation before
renderer destruction. An output-size, representation, or colorspace mismatch
rerenders the same source into the current swapchain instead of displaying an
image encoded for the old output. Unsupported formats retain the existing path.

The main trace appends `prepared_ahead` and `stage_*` fields to schema 5. Stage
decode, render-command, and output-ready boundaries precede the scheduling
decision and may precede pacing dequeue. The recorded pacing-thread decode wait
remains zero for these frames. Aggregate statistics include actual stage decode
wait and rendering service rather than counting them as queue residence.
The GPU sidecar adds `stage_render` and `stage_output_ready` spans. The latter
is a CPU completion observation, not a GPU execution timestamp or scanout proof.
Replay validates stage ordering independently of direct-worker readiness.
For direct-worker captures, serial-service revision 2 identifies post-wait
clock semantics independently of the source-mapping selection, fixing the
false exact-baseline rejection after Gemini restored decode-anchored mapping.
Counterfactual replay retains recorded stage readiness; it cannot predict
how changing GPU scheduling changes stage throughput or compositor service.

Preparation-stage validation (2026-09-21): the native incremental release and
offscreen startup help pass, as do eleven deterministic VRR/backend/profile/GPU
trace suites. Nine exact replay checks pass, including prepared-frame shutdown
while awaiting completion and the latest pre-change live capture
`20260920-231030-28049`. The signed playout-offset parser and direct readiness
clock audit were corrected without bypassing exactness checks. Evidence is in
`build/prepared-stage-validation/`. These tests do not exercise the complete
new GPU path in gameplay or establish lower physical judder; a matched live
capture is still required. No Windows build or ChaseShare deployment was made.

For performance reporting, the worker keeps the decoder-output timestamp
unchanged through this sequence. On a successful presentation it records the
full interval through presentation return and the sum of measured preparation
and presentation-call durations. Telemetry subtracts the explicit decode wait
before classifying the remaining time as queue/pacing. Failed and cancelled presentations retain outcome diagnostics but
do not enter any of these paired duration totals or their frame denominator.

The spacing floor is policy-dependent. In production, a frame classified as
latched can have the software floor disabled. Therefore “every submission is
at least one display period plus guard apart” is not a universal invariant.
The worker enforces the floor the controller returns. See the native latch
contract and historical-capture caveat in section 10 before inferring hardware
protection from this choice.

### 7.3 Waiting and scheduler accounting

`VrrTargetWaiter` uses the same monotonic clock as the controller. It sleeps
coarsely until a bounded active region, then yields/polls near the deadline.
Active waiting is capped at 500 microseconds; learned target wake lead is also
bounded at 500 microseconds. Windows prefers a high-resolution waitable timer
with a sleep fallback. Render and target wake-delay observations feed later
decisions, with separate limits.

A timer returning is not permission to submit early. The worker rereads time
and loops until the applicable floor has actually been reached. Conversely,
an OS deschedule can make it late despite a correct target. Trace planned
deadlines, actual wakeups, and native call boundaries separately.

### 7.4 Suspend, restore, cancellation, and shutdown

Minimize/suspend immediately clears queued work and wakes the worker. An
in-flight prepared image can be cancelled; the worker then blocks until restore
or stop. Display/window epoch changes invalidate current assumptions, reconcile
presenter state, and cause controller rebase. Session-level display changes can
recreate the renderer or disable VRR when refresh becomes different/unreadable.

Cancellation is backend-specific: some presenters may need a native submission
to release an acquired image. The worker accounts for that feedback and any
required spacing instead of assuming cancellation has no timing effect.
D3D11 cancellation unbinds its render target and does not use Present to cancel.

Shutdown sets stop state, wakes and joins the worker, discards remaining queued
frames, closes the trace, and conditionally saves calibration. The final
presenter cancellation releases retained native state. Avoid destroying a
decoder surface or native image while a GPU operation can still reference it.

## 8. Controller: source timeline and target construction

### 8.1 Resolve the live policy before reading parameters

`VRR_TIMING_PARAMETER_FIELDS` defines the shared parameter/serialization schema.
Its initializer values preserve older behaviors for replay and tests.
`vrrTimingParametersForSession()` overrides them for production. A comment or
schema default is insufficient evidence of the current session policy.
The diagnostics checkbox does not alter this session config or the resolved
timing parameters. Exact replay uses captured parameters, independent of whether
the recording was enabled through Settings or an external launcher.

The resolver enables timestamp playout, shared readiness history and adaptive
delay. Both Linux and Windows use the revision-7 interval policy: client-added
submission-interval error triggers growth only with attributable late work that
can fit its intended interval. The older thresholded-event policy is disabled
with `playout_readiness_hitch_threshold_us=0`. Native-hitch adaptation is disabled.
Production restores VRR14 timeline mapping anchored to decode completion (`playout_source_mapping_decoder_output=0`),
absorbing hardware decode duration into the sender offset instead of inflating client buffer delay.
It pairs this with early preparation on arrival (`playout_prepare_on_arrival=1`, `render_start_after_submission_us=0`),
spending the existing playout cushion on overlapping GPU preparation so libplacebo rendering finishes well before
the target presentation boundary.
A gate checks complete serial service for absorbability, and release is governed by recent pressure. Their
zero initializer values preserve historical replay when captures omit them.
The latency presets set independent caps; per-frame native slot protection
remains enabled.
Display smoothness feedback remains diagnostic. Historical Linux thresholded
submission-error attribution is retained for replay; live revision 7 uses the
shared interval policy described above.
Historical feedback policies remain selectable for exact replay.
It disables the retired metronome and enables preparation on arrival.
It also sets `latchedFloorDisabled=1` and disables the extra queue-mode budget.

| Preparation start | Use the existing playout interval (`playout_prepare_on_arrival=1`), with no additional post-submission delay |

The old `kPlayoutMaximumUs=8000` constant and nearby historical comments do not
define the live maximum. Likewise the retained `playoutDelayPercentilePerMille`
input of 1000 is not the active production history estimator.

### 8.2 Source clock mapping and cadence

The controller validates frame identity and RTP progression, handles wrap, and
maintains an unwrapped source timeline. Backward/invalid movement, discontinuity,
or an excessive forward interval can rebase it. Source period is fitted from
sender span divided by frame span, retaining Q16 precision and using frame-number
deltas so locally skipped frames do not become an artificial slower source.
Negotiated FPS supplies fallback timing and bounds the fitted source rate.

Cadence history is bounded (6 minimum and 512 maximum samples by schema). Loose
and tight windows are 350 ms and 1 s. A major departure uses a provisional rate
candidate; production requires at least three candidate samples spanning 200 ms
before accepting a sustained change. Isolated gaps should not temporarily turn
a high-rate stream into a low-rate stream and resize every dependent budget.

With usable RTP, the source slot is:

```text
sourceTime = unwrappedRtpInMicroseconds + appliedClockOffset
production offset observation = decoderOutputUs - unwrappedRtpInMicroseconds
```

`observePlayoutOffset()` tracks a windowed minimum of these observations, with
warmup and bounded slewing. The inherited offset window is 3 seconds and epoch
warmup is 64 samples. Historical captures can select `decodeCompleteUs`, use all
observations, and slew by 20 us per frame. Live sessions retire the observation window on phase discontinuities,
exclude ineligible samples, and preserve the applied offset rather than
re-anchoring it. They use 2400 us per second of worker decision time, capped at
100 us per observation; the raw mapping observation itself is unchanged. This prevents
an old phase minimum from steering the new phase and avoids FPS-dependent
steady-state convergence. The minimum remains an empirical client mapping,
not measured host capture latency or absolute host/client synchronization.

Timestamp mode zeroes the separate legacy readiness reserve/phase demand:
the timestamp playout delay is the jitter budget. Without valid RTP, the
controller uses its fallback cadence/readiness path, with phase and reserve
learning. Do not apply that fallback path's percentile-spread formula to normal
timestamp production behavior.

### 8.3 Cadence smoothing

The **Reduce judder** checkbox controls cadence smoothing
independently of the three VRR timing presets. It defaults on and preserves
existing saved choices. Session startup snapshots it, including across decoder
resets; reconnect after changing it. The stream CLI can override it with
`--vrr-smooth-frame-timing` or `--no-vrr-smooth-frame-timing` without saving.
The label rename preserves the `smoothvrrframetiming` INI key and
`smoothVrrFrameTiming` QML property, so existing enabled and disabled choices
carry over unchanged. Live qualification uses the four-interval gate described
in the cadence qualification correction above; explicit older captures retain
their single-interval/compensating-pair gate.

Unchecked, production follows relative RTP spacing while buffering delivery
variation. Checked, it blends 85% of the predicted source slot with 15% of the raw
mapped slot. This redistributes available waiting time to reduce adjacent
short/long intervals, at the expense of timestamp fidelity. It cannot guarantee
uniform motion between irregularly sampled images or prevent compositor jitter.
RTP values remain unchanged; their arbitrary epoch must not change scheduling.
Conceptually, with `raw = sourceTime + delayBeforeThisFrame` and the learned
readiness reserve `R` (zero for captures without the reserve parameters):

```text
trackedPeriod += 0.025 * (eligibleSourceInterval - trackedPeriod)
predicted      = previousSmoothedBasis + trackedPeriod
error          = predicted - (raw + R)
trackedPeriod -= 0.02 * error                 # phase feedback, next frame
adjustment     = 0.85 * error
adjustment     = clamp(adjustment, -(delayBeforeThisFrame + R), 6000 us - R)
smoothedBasis  = raw + R + adjustment         # cadence_smoothing_us = R + adjustment
```

`R` is applied to every timestamp-playout frame while smoothing is enabled,
including frames the smoother cannot currently place, so a cadence reset does
not step the schedule by `R`. It is learned only from frames the smoother
placed: `min(readyOffset - playoutDelay, 0) - adjustment` is the lateness caused
by moving that frame before its raw slot, and `R` tracks its p98 over the last
128 placed frames minus 500 us, capped at 3 ms. See the 2026-09-22 Reduce judder
section above for why and for its evidence.

The actual integer implementation also reseeds from the authoritative fitted
period when necessary and resets smoothing on rebases, rate/phase changes,
untrusted cadence, bursts/stalls, or excessive phase error. This is not a fixed
FPS generator. It follows genuine source-rate changes while attenuating adjacent
short/long timestamp pairs.

Production prediction anchors the next smoother state to the intended target,
not a later actual execution time. Otherwise one late frame would move later
frames and turn a temporary miss into persistent added delay. Older replay modes
retain execution-anchored smoothing and the retired metronome for compatibility.

The 6 ms cap bounds positive retiming including the reserve, not total client
latency. Readiness, queue capacity, timing-preset buffer caps and applicable
presentation floors still constrain the schedule. Smoothing does not add a
queued-frame allowance. Its readiness calibration key gains
`|frame-smoothing=150-25-6000|cadence=2-0|catchup=20|smoothing-reserve=3000-500-980-500|period-feedback=20000`
so profiles from earlier smoothing policies cannot cross-seed it.
Unchecked sessions keep their existing calibration identity. Historical traces
retain their recorded parameters and need no schema change.

The initial moderate policy was selected by exploratory replay of the completed
2026-09-10 19:34:42 local capture (76.85 FPS). It reduced submission-interval
jerk above 2 ms from 18.7% to 1.2%, with unchanged mean pacer residence and
0.28 ms more p99 residence. The exact gate failed native-outcome validation;
this is not strict A/B proof or a live visual result. Raw presented jerk and
sender-spacing residual must both be reported: deliberate retiming increases
the latter even when cadence becomes more regular. The deterministic
77 FPS alternating-jitter fixture with clean delivery adds 2.6–3.5 ms mean
delay across presets; spare buffering and workload determine the live cost.

### 8.4 Target, render start, and latch request

The general target construction is:

```text
target = sourceTime + readinessBudget + cadenceSmoothing
       + playoutDelay + renderOffset + presentationSafety
target = max(target, now + renderOffset + presentationSafety)
```

In timestamp production, `readinessBudget` is zero. With prediction enabled,
the nominal render contribution uses typical render work; preparation lead is
a separate scheduling budget. The mapped slot uses the delay in force before
this frame's update. Learning must not retroactively replace its already chosen
source slot with the next delay value.

Implausibly future projections can reseed phase. Production waits for three
qualifying projections, so one early timestamp does not shift the entire stream.
A late frame can clamp to the present execution opportunity while the next
frame retains its own source slot.

Production sets `playout_adaptive_only=0`, `playout_per_frame_latch=1`, and
`playout_rate_protection_enabled=0`. Before applying software spacing floors,
each target is compared with `lastSubmission + displayPeriod + guard`.
This restores vrr14's planned-slot protection rule, without vrr17's extra
225/400 us entry/exit allowance. If it falls earlier and the presenter supports native protection, that slot is latched
and its software floor is disabled. Otherwise the adaptive floor applies.
DXGI uses `Present(1, 0)` for protected slots and
`Present(0, DXGI_PRESENT_ALLOW_TEARING)` for slots that clear that threshold. Diagnostic composition already
provides native ordering; its protection capability likewise permits a slot
without the extra CPU floor. It does not expose DXGI tearing flags.

`lastSubmission` in that rule is the spacing anchor, not always the previous
Present call (`latched_flip_anchor=1` in production since 2026-09-22). A
latched present waits in the flip queue until the previous flip plus one
display period, so its anchor is `max(call, previous anchor + displayPeriod)`.
Anchoring to the call let the next tearing present flip inside the panel's
minimum period after a late or compressed frame; capture
`20260922-184032-168` modelled 68 such tears in 91 s at 116/120 (PresentMon on
the 09-21 sandbox capture confirmed the queue model). The worker's final
recheck and replay's recheck mirror use `untornReferenceUs()`: the anchor for
a tearing present, the call for a latched one. Production also latches the
first present whose target is at least `vrr_floor_latch_gap_us=20000` after
the anchor, since the panel may be repeating the previous frame below its VRR
range. Both parameters default to 0, so older captures replay exactly. The
replay's `tear_risks` does not model the flip queue and cannot score this.
Remaining known tear source: AMD present-to-flip latency (PresentMon
msUntilDisplayed p50 1.3 / p99 4.7 ms) can squeeze adaptive pairs spaced just
above the panel minimum.

This allows source-rate changes and recovery from late work without permanently
carrying a refresh-plus-guard delay into every subsequent frame. The explicit
adaptive-only policy remains replayable and takes precedence over latch flags.
Historical rate protection uses the shared below-refresh recommendation cutoff.
Backends without native protection enforce the display-period-plus-guard
software spacing floor. Their presentation mode remains unchanged.

Revision 2 retains vrr17's extra headroom for explicit historical replay;
revision 0 retains the older cadence-based latch policy. At steady
116 FPS / 120 Hz, rounded periods are 8621 and 8333 us with a 100 us base guard:
188 us clears revision 1's interval check but not VRR12's 225 us entry margin.
Historical revision 2 added that allowance on the planned per-frame interval,
without reinstating the 64-frame recovery hold or changing buffer targets.
Neither threshold proves scanout prediction accuracy. Both versions start
their spacing calculation at CPU submission.
The extra margin is a historical safety allowance, not a measured bound on
driver/flip/scanout delay. Native synchronized presents may change actual
latency and cadence even when planned targets are identical. A capture from
the affected machine and Windows visual validation are still required.

Historical revision-2 validation on macOS, 2026-09-12: timing-controller, rate-policy, pacing-worker,
replay-config, DXGI-call-boundary, profile, Vulkan mode-selection and persistent
mode-capability tests pass. The new headroom regressions fail against the
unchanged VRR16 calculation and pass after the correction. Fresh single-frame
and warm-history schema-5 worker fixtures pass exact replay with complete
sequence integrity; all five responsive-buffer stress scenarios pass their
interval and 30 ms p99 latency assertions without saturation. These fixtures
are synthetic. Results are under `build/vrr-hybrid/final-*`; no affected-user
capture was available, no native Windows/Linux gameplay was tested, and no
Windows release or ChaseShare update was produced from this macOS checkout.

Follow-up report: the affected user also sees tearing in Lowest latency and
Balanced well below the refresh ceiling; vrr12 and vrr13 reportedly worked
there, while vrr13 failed higher in the range. The restored 225/400 us margin
does not by itself explain or establish a fix for this broader report.
Comparison of the actual vrr12/vrr13 tags identifies additional differences:

- Both older controllers used 64 clean frames of latch recovery after startup,
  ineligible cadence, source-rate changes or phase discontinuities. Per-frame
  revisions 1 and 2 bypass that recovery state even though it is still counted.
- Both older Windows renderers used `Present(0, 0)` for protected frames. Their
  D3D11 source is identical. Current DXGI protection uses `Present(1, 0)`;
  restoring headroom does not restore the old native queue semantics.
- VRR12 retained its submission-spacing floor for every frame. VRR13 disabled
  it for latched frames while still issuing interval-zero native calls. This is
  a relevant high-rate difference, not proof of the reported failure's cause.
- Older smoothing continued from the late-clamped/floored target. Current
  smoothing continues from the original intended target, allowing quicker
  recovery and potentially shorter following intervals. VRR12/13 also used
  different tail-based buffering and did not have the current latency presets.

Both generations anchor software spacing at CPU submission, not verified
image-change time. A large average source interval therefore does not establish
physical scanout headroom, particularly through stalls or native mode changes.
Distinguish steady-state behavior from recovery and identify the affected native
backend before attributing the report to prediction accuracy. Linux's persistent
presentation modes remain separate from these Windows per-present flags.

Prediction-only production ignores the presentation model's compositor lead
and scanout floor. Deadlines use the mapped source cadence, readiness protection
and measured local work/scheduler budgets. `earliestSubmissionUs()` supplies
the local submission-spacing floor. The existing `predicted_scanout_us` trace
field equals the submission target in this policy; it is not a calibrated
measurement of physical scanout. Historical policies can still learn a
compositor lead and scanout floor from native observations.

Normally that earliest submission is
`lastSubmission + displayPeriod + guard + entrySafetyHeadroom` for revision 2;
historical revisions omit the last term.
With `latchedFloorDisabled` and a latched decision it returns zero. This is a
deliberate reliance on native presentation behavior; it must be checked against
the actual renderer implementation, not inferred from the request flag.

Preparation starts ahead of the target using the existing playout interval plus
learned render/scheduler budgets. Production enables preparation on arrival on
both platforms and removes the former 6 ms post-submission software delay.
Native acquisition still supplies backpressure when images are unavailable;
deferring the start in software cannot make those images available sooner.
The 3 ms render-lead floor remains subject to source-rate and capacity bounds.
Historical traces retain their explicit preparation and spacing parameters.

## 9. Active production learning and bounded delay

### 9.1 Readiness prediction

`schedule()` retains a pending probe: immutable mapping time, intended source slot,
period, typical render cost, applied delay, guard, and decoder backlog.
Responsive production uses the raw mapped RTP slot for FIFO prediction and
accounts for any smoothing advance separately in the recent estimator. The
historical readiness-driven policy uses the smoothed slot with padding removed.
Preparation and scheduler measurements are recorded for future decisions.
On successful non-cancelled submission, `ReadinessPrediction` models expected
and actual FIFO service using those measurements, excluding intentional pacing
and acquisition waiting from work that should become learned reserve.

The live interval observer also keeps raw preparation, acquisition, explicit
decoder wait, render-scheduler delay, and deferred completion separate. Its
serial-service gate subtracts acquisition from preparation because waiting for a
native image is not throughput that added source buffering can shorten. It then
takes the larger of preparation service and its conservative deferred GPU bound,
then adds the preceding explicit decoder wait and render-scheduler delay. That service gate is
distinct from readiness lateness: readiness explains which interval was delayed,
while serial service decides whether another standing frame could absorb it.

The readiness-history model compares expected progress with actual readiness. Clean samples enter
the reserve immediately. Backlog and work/scheduler/decoder-queue episodes over
a source period are held until recovery. An episode that persists for 2 seconds
or fills the 512-sample holding array is treated as sustained overload rather
than ordinary jitter to absorb with more delay. Once service recovers, the
model can distinguish a recoverable burst from a pipeline that cannot sustain
the stream.

### 9.2 Reserve history and smoothness feedback

The version-18/19 descriptions below are historical. Current production uses
version 20 for five-minute raw FIFO-readiness diagnostics and a separate
`RecentReadiness` estimator for live control (section 9.3). Cached diagnostics
are not a live growth or release gate. Native feedback remains diagnostic.

Linux uses `ReadinessFeedback` and `Reserve(19)`. For consecutive eligible
submissions it compares actual spacing with intended target spacing, then
requires the delayed frame's decode readiness plus preparation/render-wakeup
work to exceed its intended target. Demand is that frame's existing buffer plus
the smaller of spacing error and readiness lateness, minus the 2 ms tolerance.
A catch-up interval uses the earlier delayed frame's buffer, avoiding a second
charge against a newly increased buffer. Native blocking alone, source cadence
variation alone, missing/discontinuous frames, and work or decoder backpressure
exceeding a source period cannot authorize growth. This is observable attribution,
not proof of a counterfactual display outcome; readiness waits include scheduling.

Version 19 rejects predictive version-18 profiles. Its history may retain or
release padding, but only a fresh eligible miss raises requested padding, so a
cached tail cannot drive a new session to the cap. The fixed 3 ms prediction
margin is not added. Existing attack/release limits, source-frame allowance,
and absolute 16 ms cap remain. Historical trace parameters default the new field
to zero. Normal replay selects the Linux rule for a declared Vulkan backend;
exact replay always uses captured parameters. Windows production is unchanged
by this rule.


Windows readiness history uses `Vrr13::Reserve(18)`. Version 18 isolates
prediction-only calibration from native-hitch release floors and older combined
feedback estimates. Readiness history controls both increasing and decreasing
padding; native and CPU submission interval errors do not become buffer demand.
Namespace/file version names do not mean the older algorithm
is active. Reserve uses nanoseconds, 250 us histogram bins, and one-second aging
buckets over approximately five minutes. Allocation is kept out of ordinary
frame observation.

The empirical quantile inside Reserve is p99.95 nearest-rank. All valid samples,
including successes, contribute to the denominator. Versions 15 and 16 consider a
readiness miss when required protection exceeds available protection by at least
3 ms. A recent miss affects trust and temporary boost rather than being silently
diluted by a long good history.

Release can start after a short warmup: at least 32 samples spanning 2 seconds,
with a recent miss blocking release for 2 seconds. That is separate from the
stronger reliability condition involving longer history and at most 0.05%
misses. Five-minute retention does not mean every startup waits five minutes
before adaptation.

There are separate submission and native `SmoothnessFeedback` instances for
diagnostics. Native intervals are compared against `sourceTimeUs`, preserving
relative game cadence while excluding changes in padding, render estimates and
compositor prediction from the desired interval. A measured cadence error must
exceed 3 ms after uncertainty handling to count as a hitch. Source-rate
transitions and host stalls retain the existing eligibility exclusions. These
observations never request or block prediction-only buffer changes. Native
confirmation is OS timing evidence, not optical proof of a perceived hitch.

In the historical native-hitch policy, stretch charges the current frame;
catch-up charges the preceding delayed frame
using that frame's original padding. Each newly confirmed miss supplies demand
once; historical histogram tails cannot repeatedly authorize growth. Missing,
out-of-order, ambiguous, or unmatched native feedback cannot manufacture a miss.
Legacy policies retain their inclusive threshold, original target/scanout
references, and readiness/combined-feedback adaptation for exact replay.
The new parameter defaults to zero when absent from older captures.

`PresentationPrediction` requires explicit display-event timestamps for production
cadence diagnostics and matches them to submitted present IDs. DXGI refresh references remain usable
only by the legacy replay policy; matching their refresh identity does not turn
them into display events. Stale, future, or too-uncertain observations are
ignored. The inspected implementation bounds sample age at 100 ms and native
uncertainty at 500 us, learns a rolling median ready-to-presentation lead, and
uses fresh matched observations for its floor in historical policies only.
Production ignores both the lead and floor. Its `smoothnessProtectionUs`
diagnostic and user-facing smoothness score use submission prediction even when
native events are available. Missing native feedback remains missing in the
separate tracking counters.

### 9.3 Delay update and capacity formulas

`updatePlayoutDelay()` dispatches directly to `updatePlayoutHistory()` when
history is enabled. The later per-rate-band reservoir/percentile branch is
legacy/replay behavior. In that branch 1000 per mille means p100, 999 means
p99.9, and 995 means p99.5. Those values must not be confused with the active
Reserve p99.95 implementation.

Production sets `playout_prediction_only=1` and `playout_responsive_buffer=7`
for every normal VRR session. The interval-quality observer described above owns
requested delay, with 125 us per-frame attack application and preset-timed
release. It bypasses the following historical percentile growth/release law.
The retired revision-4 estimator keeps 100 ms buckets over the selected preset's learning
window, including successes. Lowest latency uses 99% over 30 seconds, Balanced
99.5% over 60 seconds, and Smoothest 99.95% over 120 seconds. These are
historical best-effort targets within the retired 16 ms latency cap. Historical revisions 1
and 2 retain their three-second p99 estimator for exact replay.
Raw readiness is measured against RTP
source slots in the FIFO model; an earlier smoothed deadline is a separate
cost applied before clamping away early-readiness slack. Revision 1 incorrectly
discarded that slack first, charging reserve even when an advanced deadline was
already covered. In the historical gate, large source changes disable smoothing until 200 ms of eligible
cadence falls within 25% of the fitted period. Revision 2 evaluates compensating
short/long outliers together, so alternating 9/17 ms intervals at a stable 77 FPS
do not keep Reduce judder disabled. A sustained same-direction change still
uses individual intervals and resets confidence. This confidence uses source
time, not a fixed frame count. Actual RTP
spacing remains eligible for delivery learning while the rate fit catches up.

A readiness shortfall over 2 ms renews a two-second burst boost. A shortfall
over 1 ms through 2 ms permits growth only when more than half of the current
readiness window exceeds 1 ms. Shortfalls through 1 ms never grow the buffer.
Only fresh hard misses renew the boost; old histogram or cache tails cannot. The target adds
500 us to the larger of the selected recent percentile and that boost, bounded by the existing
minimum, the live fitted-period preset maximum (or the configured-rate maximum
for historical captures), the 16 ms ceiling, and queue capacity.
Growth is at most 500 us per update. Release requires 32 recent observations,
two seconds of live history, no miss for two seconds, and a sample within
250 ms. It approaches the recent target at approximately 1.2 ms/second, up to
twice that with spare display and processing capacity, at most 250 us per
frame. Thus the falling recent target probes downward without waiting for
five-minute diagnostic tails. Silence/overload is not clean release evidence.
Requested demand remains visible above the cap for capacity diagnostics when
`playout_capacity_telemetry=1`, but is recomputed every frame rather than stored
as debt. No new queue is added. This distinction makes a demand clipped by the
observed-cadence cap measurable instead of making the applied buffer look as if
it absorbed the entire stall.
Revision 3 and later retire live learning history on a confirmed material source-rate
change while preserving the applied buffer for gradual recovery. Host stalls
above max(25 ms, 1.5 source periods) and catch-up intervals below half a source
period do not train the estimator; their playback outcomes still affect the
displayed readiness result. The diagnostic five-minute calibration is unchanged.

Historical prediction-only mode (`playout_responsive_buffer=0`) behaves as follows:

- Required protection is readiness p99.95 plus any recent readiness-miss boost,
  then 3,000 us of headroom. The model includes delivery variation, FIFO render
  work and render scheduler delays, excluding intentional pacing, swapchain
  acquisition waits and post-submission display latency.
- Padding grows toward that requirement by at most 500 us per update. It does
  not wait for a displayed hitch. Existing protection is compared with the
  requirement, rather than added to the next demand. The cold-start seed is
  applied once and is not added again when calculating headroom.
- Padding shrinks toward the same requirement after readiness history warms
  (32 samples and 2 seconds) and any readiness miss has been absent for 2 seconds.
  No display sample is required. The 10 us release input scales by elapsed time
  at a 120 FPS reference, capped at 33,333 us of elapsed recovery per update.
- Readiness tails still age out over the existing five-minute window; a brief
  clean period does not immediately erase a recent burst or valid cached tail.
- Capacity and the selected timing allowance remain hard bounds
  in both directions. Lowest latency allows half a fitted source period,
  Balanced one period, and Smoothest two periods. These bounds can prevent the
  full 3 ms headroom.

The legacy readiness and combined-feedback laws remain available for replay.

Queue capacity is an independent hard bound:

```text
period          = min(fittedSourcePeriod, negotiatedStreamPeriod)
capacity        = 3 * period
occupied        = renderLead + presentationSafety
                + (smoothingEnabled ? maximumSmoothingLag : 0)
queueDelayLimit = max(0, capacity - occupied)
modeAllowance   = Smooth: fittedSourcePeriod * 4000 / 1000
                | Balanced Target: fittedSourcePeriod * 2000 / 1000
                | Low Latency: fittedSourcePeriod * 1000 / 1000
maximumInput    = Smooth: 24000 us | other presets: 16000 us
effectiveMin    = min(1000 us, queueDelayLimit, modeAllowance)
effectiveMax    = min(maximumInput, queueDelayLimit, modeAllowance)
```

`maximumSmoothingLag` is `playout_smoothing_max_lag_us` (6 ms in production
since 2026-09-22, 2 ms before), which also contains the smoothing readiness
reserve. With Reduce judder on, 120 FPS therefore leaves a 16 ms queue delay
limit after a 3 ms render lead (unchanged in practice, because the 16 ms input
binds), while 144 FPS drops from 15.8 to 11.8 ms. Total buffering plus positive
retiming stays within the same three-period capacity.

The cold start first takes `max(6000 us, 0.95 * sourcePeriod)`, caps that by
`max(displayPeriod, renderLead)` for history mode, then clamps to effective
minimum/maximum. Consequently neither “the buffer always starts at 6 ms” nor
"the maximum is 8 ms" describes current production. The 16/16/24 ms absolute
ceilings are further reduced by the selected source-frame allowance and
three-frame queue-capacity bound. In particular, a four-frame Smooth allowance
does not allocate four waiting frames or guarantee that all four fit. The allowance is not a promise of total
decode-to-submission latency because rendering and applicable native/CPU floors
remain outside the adaptive playout buffer.

More protection can improve jitter tolerance while consuming latency and queue
capacity. If the requested protection exceeds capacity, record the limitation
rather than presenting the capped policy as able to absorb all observed work.

### 9.4 Persisted calibration

`vrr13-calibration.json` lives under the cache path. The profile key includes
display identity, stream FPS, display refresh, smoothing settings,
and session context, including the active native presenter. Balanced Target and
Low Latency add distinct timing-mode suffixes. Enabled smoothing also appends
`|frame-smoothing=150-25-6000|cadence=2-0|catchup=20` and, when the reserve or
period feedback is active, `|smoothing-reserve=3000-500-980-500|period-feedback=20000`
to isolate its readiness history.
Profiles expire after 14 days; saves require at least
240 observations, use locking/atomic replacement, and cap storage at 16 profiles.

Responsive production accepts version-20 raw readiness histograms for diagnostics
only. Startup uses the existing bounded cold-start seed; cached tails cannot
raise or hold the live request. The separate recent estimator starts empty.
Historical prediction-only mode accepts version-18 readiness histograms; versions
from native-hitch and earlier policies are rejected. Its requested protection
uses the readiness distribution and recent boost, not a display-validated
"proven buffer". Reserve ages the prior and replaces its mass
with live evidence over time. Short interrupted runs preserve a more protective
prior instead of automatically erasing it. Cached evidence is not proof of
current-session coverage. Display epoch changes invalidate calibration saving.
Full reset and phase rebase differ: a rebase can preserve learned playout state
while clearing transient timing predictors.

The live interval buffer's initial-calibration flag is not loaded from this
cache. It starts unqualified, requires both 500 ms and 32 consecutive intervals,
and remains complete across subsequent sequence breaks and FPS changes. The
one-second error window, growth cooldown, long quality history and release
holds are independent of this startup shortcut. A broken sequence subsequently
requires a full second before adaptation resumes. The trace captures
`playout_interval_initial_warmup_us` and
`playout_interval_initial_minimum_samples`; missing fields default to the
historical one-second/two-interval behavior, preserving exact replay.

## 10. Windows D3D11 mechanics and native synchronization

### 10.1 Eligibility and GPU synchronization

The renderer prefers the adapter owning the display, creates a flip-discard
HWND swapchain with five buffers, and chooses appropriate RGBA/10-bit format.
It checks tearing support and uses `DXGI_SWAP_CHAIN_FLAG_ALLOW_TEARING` when
supported. Adaptive eligibility checks effective V-sync, borderless fullscreen,
flip-model state, refresh, renderer threading, readiness fencing, tearing
capability/flags, and render/output adapter compatibility. Actual swapchain and
fullscreen descriptors are rechecked through display transitions.

The source deliberately avoids assuming `SetMaximumFrameLatency(1)` is a free
latency improvement: with interval-zero presentation it can make Present block
in a V-sync-like way. Swapchain buffer count is not the worker queue capacity.

With separate decode/render devices, `captureDecodeBoundary()` signals a shared
decode-to-render fence when a decoder output is handed off. Rendering waits for
that exact value, so it need not wait for newer decode work. Render-to-decode
ordering protects texture reuse. The purpose is both correctness and avoiding
accidental waits for work belonging to subsequent frames.
`renderVideo()` queues `ID3D11DeviceContext4::Wait` for the captured boundary
before any copy or shader read; that GPU dependency is the correctness mechanism.
With monitored fences, the worker's `waitForDecode()` also blocks until the
exact captured value completes, taking no context lock and using its own event
with the 50 ms / fence-value-verified wait described below. That post-wait clock
is `decodeCompleteUs`, which production source mapping requires to absorb
hardware decode time (the Linux `vaSyncSurface()` equivalent). Between
`78b99f1c` and 2026-09-22 this check was nonblocking, which left Windows mapped
from decoder output while Linux mapped from completion. Non-monitored fences and
shared devices remain nonblocking; there, a zero CPU decode-wait measurement
does not mean the decode dependency was already complete.

Two mutexes serialize this renderer. FFmpeg's D3D11VA lock (`m_ContextLock`)
guards the decode device's immediate context; FFmpeg holds it for each frame's
entire decode submission. A separate presentation lock guards the render
context, swapchain and prepared VRR frame against window-change callbacks. The
presentation lock includes FFmpeg's lock only when decode and render share one
immediate context. On separate devices, preparation and `Present` never hold
FFmpeg's lock; `renderVideo()` and `captureDecodeBoundary()` take it only
around decode-context `Signal`/`Wait`/`Flush`. Lock order is presentation, then
context.

Preparation binds and clears the backbuffer, renders video and overlays, and sets
colorspace/HDR state. Direct decoder texture binding follows stock Moonlight on
Intel and on separate decode/render devices. AMD/NVIDIA single-device sessions
keep the compatibility copy below 4K; 4K streams bind when the GPU has Feature
Level 11.1+ or D3D11 fences. It holds the presentation lock while manipulating
render state. Immediately after recording the frame, preparation signals and
flushes a present-ready fence, arms its event, and performs one nonblocking value
poll. It publishes the prepared frame without waiting for completion, reports
`sourceFrameReusable=false`, and releases the presentation lock before the
worker's cadence hold. The source `AVFrame` remains owned through presentation;
on the separate-device path, the render-to-decode fence also protects decoder-
surface reuse.

At the target boundary `presentAdaptive()` reacquires the presentation lock and
verifies that exact present-ready value before calling `Present`. It releases
that lock while waiting (on a shared device this also lets decode continue), then
reacquires and revalidates the prepared frame, display state and device. Usually the cadence hold
has already covered the GPU work and this is a completed-value poll. A late frame
pays only the residual wait at the target. The complete fence wait has a 50 ms
bound, blocks on the event in 1 ms slices, and checks the fence value between
waits; the value, rather than notification delivery alone, proves readiness. A
stale notification cannot release incomplete work, and a delayed notification
cannot hold already-completed work for 50 ms. Display/resize mutation drains an
outstanding prepared fence before invalidating its backbuffer. The device-removed
sentinel is rejected. A true fence timeout or wait failure disables the adaptive
path and requests recovery; its log includes the target, final completed value,
last event result and device status.
Decode-to-render and render-to-decode Signal/Wait failures likewise abort frame
preparation and request device recovery; an unsynchronized frame is never
submitted as a fallback.
`gpu_ready_wait_result` records the aggregate fence-wait status in Win32 wait
codes; individual slice timeouts are not whole-fence failures. The trace's poll
fields describe the first poll at the final Present-boundary check, replacing
the nonblocking preparation poll when that check runs. A cancelled frame before
the final check can still carry the preparation poll. Poll and final readiness
timestamps retain conservative completion bounds. Historical captures retain
their original single-event-wait observations unchanged.

When the target-boundary check completes successfully, the VRR worker records its
residual verified wait as `gpu_readiness_applied_us` and the next controller
decision exposes the bounded `gpu_readiness_lead_us`. The estimator uses only completed waits in
the current ten-second window, takes the configured percentile (99% in live
sessions), adds a 500 us margin, and slews toward that demand. It is a render
start opportunity, not a promise of completion: a late fence still follows the
existing failure/recovery and presentation path, and the current source target
is never moved to hide the stall.

Fence completion proves the prepared backbuffer work has finished before Present.
If the recorded poll found the value complete, its end is the completion upper
bound; otherwise the successful final wait is the upper bound. A final-boundary
poll may overstate service because the fence could have completed earlier during
the cadence hold. Replay accepts either a preparation poll or a final poll and
anchors counterfactual upper-bound mapping according to that poll's placement.
The controller uses the resulting uncertainty conservatively for the serial-
service gate. CPU poll/event brackets are not an exact hardware timestamp or a
measurement of total GPU execution time.

### 10.2 Native Present parameters and telemetry

On the DXGI path, `D3D11VARenderer::presentAdaptive()` creates one
`DxgiPresentParameters` value from the controller's latch request. The same value supplies native
telemetry and `presentPreparedFrame()`, which forwards it to DXGI:

- Latched: `Present(1, 0)`.
- Adaptive: `Present(0, DXGI_PRESENT_ALLOW_TEARING)`.
- Legacy: interval zero with the existing `legacyPresentFlags()` value.

The controller can omit its software spacing floor for a latched decision;
passing interval one to DXGI is therefore part of the renderer contract.
`tst_dxgipresent` exercises the actual shared call boundary using a fake
swapchain, including transitions, parameter reporting, and native result
propagation. Actual display behavior still requires Windows validation.

Historical builds computed and recorded interval one but hardcoded zero in
the native helper. Their `latched_present` and native interval fields describe
intent, not proof that DXGI received interval one. Replay cannot repair that
old instrumentation or turn historical `confirmed_safe_latched` classifications
into independent scanout evidence. Check the executable used for each capture.

`restoreFixedPresentation()` disables VRR and retains the swapchain. The legacy
software-paced caller still explicitly uses interval zero; this correction does
not change its pacing mechanism.

### 10.3 Native evidence limits

Only `S_OK` is treated as a presented result. Failed calls request recovery;
non-display success statuses such as occlusion are cancellation outcomes rather
than proof of monitor delivery.

`GetLastPresentCount()` and `GetFrameStatistics()` can report earlier operations.
`PresentRefreshCount` and `SyncRefreshCount` are different identities;
`SyncQPCTime` timestamps the sync observation and is not automatically the
presentation timestamp of the accompanying present ID.

Production cadence diagnostics require `playout_require_display_events=1`. Presentation feedback
explicitly distinguishes unavailable timestamps, refresh references, and display
events. DXGI `GetFrameStatistics()` is marked as a refresh reference and cannot
teach compositor latency, authorize buffer growth/release, or create a measured
cadence sample, even when its refresh IDs match and its timestamp follows
submission. The Windows-host vrr14/vrr15 captures and the Ally GTA capture
demonstrate why: different present IDs can share an identical raw `SyncQPCTime`,
including frames submitted after that reference. A reference is not the frame's
image-change instant. The old inference remains available only through explicit
historical replay parameters; missing `playout_require_display_events` defaults
to zero to preserve old exact baselines. New schema-5 traces additionally record
`latch_time_kind` (0 unavailable, 1 refresh reference, 2 display event).

The DXGI statistics provider supplies no verified display events. Production
always uses submission estimates for its client cadence report.
Readiness prediction independently adapts padding in both directions. Composition-frame statistics also lack a verified frame
display instant, so the same estimator covers periods without independent-flip
events. This lower-confidence timing remains internal telemetry; it does not
claim native display coverage or learn display-service latency from it.
Linux Wayland presentation feedback and Gamescope actual-present timestamps
are explicitly marked as display events and remain eligible for measurement.

`MOONLIGHT_VRR_ALIGN=1` enables observation-only raster probes around Present.
DisplayConfig signal geometry and QPC correlation support phase modeling.
`D3DKMTGetScanLine()` reports raster position around a CPU observation; it does
not establish when a queued flip became visible. Cloned/ambiguous display paths
must not be silently treated as an exact calibration match.

Software timing, tearing permission, and modeled active-scanout exposure do not
confirm an optical tear or its absence. External display measurement is needed
for that claim.

### 10.4 Diagnostic composition presentation

DXGI is the Windows VRR default. Only `MOONLIGHT_VRR_COMPOSITION=1` enables
composition device flags and attempts to initialize the composition presenter.
The value is captured during renderer initialization, so a stream reconnect is
required. Startup logs identify the actual presenter, including setup fallback.

The renderer checks the actual OS version using `RtlGetVersion` (including
revision 194 on build 22000), loads `CreatePresentationFactory` dynamically,
and requires `IsPresentationSupportedWithIndependentFlip()`. OS version alone
is insufficient. The render device uses BGRA support and disables internal
threading optimizations as required by this API; an unsupported device retries
with the original DXGI device flags. Setup failure retains the DXGI path.
System-relative presentation time is QPC scaled to 100 ns with the actual QPC
frequency. It no longer depends on resolving an interrupt-clock export or assumes
that the interrupt-clock epoch equals the presentation clock's epoch.

`D3D11CompositionPresenter` owns five displayable textures, a presentation
manager/surface, and a DirectComposition visual bound to the streaming window.
Initial allocation and each resize explicitly set the surface source rectangle
to the full buffer; omitting this leaves successful submissions with no image.
The same shaders, overlays, colorspace, GPU-ready fence, and pacing deadline
are used. Buffer acquisition checks availability without waiting. Submission
cancels older pending presents and targets the current QPC-derived presentation time, with
no added source period or wait for a presentation event. `ForceVSyncInterrupt`
requests prompt statistics even with hardware flip queues. Buffer storage
is not a queue-depth target; OS/driver scheduling still needs measurement.

Only independent-flip statistics with the matching surface tag, output adapter,
source ID, and increasing present ID become display events. Their 100 ns system-relative
timestamps are correlated with scaled QPC through a fresh bracket on the worker
clock, with bounded age and uncertainty. Composition statistics do not become
display events. The backend is trace value 3; DXGI flags, query results, and raw
QPC fields remain unset. Native ordering lets the controller omit the software
floor for a protected slot, as on DXGI, without claiming DXGI flag switching. Resize replaces
buffers; display changes recreate the renderer and its output identity.

`compositionprobe --run` is an optional fullscreen Windows hardware diagnostic
for independent-flip coverage and submission-to-display latency. It does not
prove optical VRR, tear freedom, or end-to-end latency. No live hardware result
is claimed by the platform-neutral tests or cross-compilation.

## 11. Other presentation paths

The shared presenter interface separates support checks, decode-boundary
capture/readiness, preparation, adaptive presentation, cancellation, and feedback.
Its implementations can have different acquisition and cancellation semantics.
Completion feedback may be available during preparation, deferred until the
native-present boundary, or unavailable when the backend instead retains source
ownership asynchronously. The worker treats those cases explicitly.
Do not transfer D3D11 fence or Present assumptions directly to Vulkan.

On Linux the VRR request prefers the Vulkan frontend. The adaptive mode is
selected for the surface at startup: Mailbox on ordinary Wayland, Immediate on
X11/KMSDRM, and Immediate on Gamescope. Gamescope additionally tries Mailbox
when the dormant SteamOS experiment is enabled, according to exposed surface
capabilities.

The startup decoder probe that asks the host for a color range must use that
same Linux Vulkan preference without activating VRR presentation.
`chooseDecoder()` still forbids `enableVrr` in test-only mode; the probe passes
`preferVrrRenderer` from the session VRR snapshot instead. Otherwise an EGL
probe can request limited-range video while VRR playback interprets it as full
range, which washes out SDR. Vulkan's AMF AV1 full-range mapping override
applies only when the negotiated stream range is full. HDR remains gated on the
client's Enable HDR preference; VRR does not advertise 10-bit formats by itself.

For VAAPI hardware frames, the worker performs the explicit `vaSyncSurface()`
readiness check once and records its CPU wait. Preparation no longer repeats that
explicit synchronization; libplacebo's `AV_HWFRAME_MAP_READ` import still
validates/maps the dependency. A failed explicit VA sync disables the adaptive
path and requests renderer recovery before preparation can import or read the
surface. This removes redundant CPU serialization without treating decoder
output as proof of GPU completion.

Hardware Vulkan preparation retains the mapped `pl_frame`, including libplacebo's
AVFrame reference and imported source textures, until their GPU reads finish.
Retained hardware output is submitted asynchronously in every presentation mode:
libplacebo transitions the output image, signals a render-complete semaphore, and supplies it to
`vkQueuePresentKHR`. CPU completion is not required for this handoff. Preparation,
presentation and cancellation retire idle source mappings and preparation reports
`sourceFrameReusable=true` only when no retained mapping remains. This releases
the worker's surface before the target hold without recycling external decoder
memory while Vulkan reads it. Cancellation and failure can leave mappings pending;
they remain owned until idle or healthy-GPU teardown finishes them.

The first asynchronous output-wait bypass was withdrawn after the 2026-09-19 23:54:19
clean capture: 117.67 incoming FPS, 85.29 rendered FPS, 27.52% client drops and
zero network drops. Concurrent Vibeshine capture was reported to cause a hard
stall. Restoring the barrier did not establish the cause. The subsequent trace
proved decode-wait discard starvation, corrected in `78b99f1c`. The 00:30:01
launch then produced 76.11% client timing / 100.23 rendered FPS at 301.5 Mbps,
versus 99.67% / 117.37 FPS at 57 Mbps, both Smooth without concurrent capture.
After 20 seconds from the first arrival, high-bitrate presented frames averaged 9.559 ms of serial
decode-wait + preparation + submission service against an 8.333 ms period.

The updated path pairs asynchronous retained-hardware output and the corrected stale
policy with preparation on arrival. It retains up to four source mappings to
prevent capacity stalls, applies bounded retirement backpressure before acquiring another swapchain image, and
never calls an unavailable output-completion sample a zero-duration completion.
Immediate presentation omits that CPU completion check
when the source mapping is retained. GPU-delayed flips may still bunch despite
correctly spaced CPU submissions. Software and unretained imports keep the 50 ms / 100,000-observation output-poll bound.
D3D11 fence/event fields remain unset on Vulkan rows. Windows explicitly flushes the decoder context
after signaling its cross-device boundary, so dispatch does not depend on a later input frame.

The selected adaptive mode remains immutable for the lifetime of one persistent
swapchain. Per-frame controller requests never destroy or recreate that chain.
Persistent Mailbox provides synchronized, stale-image-replacing presentation,
so it advertises protected latch support without a native mode change or the
controller's redundant software spacing floor. Immediate retains the
display-period-plus-guard floor because it may tear. Explicit historical
revision 2 adds a 225 us entry margin to that floor; current revision 1 does not.
That historical extra spacing can reduce sustainable throughput near native refresh;
worker stale-frame replacement remains responsible for bounded backlog.
It does not turn Immediate into a tear-free native presentation mode.
A FIFO-only compatibility path likewise does not advertise
adaptive latch support because it may accumulate queued frames. Actual resize,
reset, or fallback can recreate the swapchain and restores the cached
colorspace/HDR hint before the next acquisition. Deterministic tests do not
establish compositor or physical scanout behavior.

Gamescope WSI's FIFO compatibility exception is used when Immediate is unavailable
and the Mailbox experiment is disabled or Mailbox is unavailable. Although the WSI layer sends Mailbox to the underlying
driver, it forwards the application's original present mode to Gamescope, which
implements FIFO commit scheduling itself. Selecting Mailbox explicitly avoids
that FIFO policy. Steam's frame
limiter can still override a request to FIFO. Native presentation here remains
compositor-owned, and submission success is not physical scanout feedback.
See [SteamOS VRR investigation](docs/steamos-vrr.md) for source evidence and the
reversible composition test for performance-overlay-dependent stutter.
Unsupported renderer combinations
fall back to fixed pacing. Windows Vulkan remains rejected and the macOS path
does not gain on-demand mode switching. DRM VRR properties, compositor policy,
and physical scanout evidence remain separate from the client's mode request.

Gamescope timing rejection counters are cumulative across swapchain resets and
logged at renderer teardown. They distinguish empty queries, returned and emitted
records, unmatched IDs, timestamps before submission or in the future, stale or
invalid timestamps, clock-correlation failures, and skipped warmup. They do not
relax validation or change pacing. Sparse usable feedback alone does not establish
that the compositor dropped the other frames. The installed Gamescope 3.16.23.5
source supplies its scheduled vblank target as `actualPresentTime`; these records
must not be treated as an independent physical scanout measurement.

The worker presents only newly received frames and waits for queue activity
when empty. It no longer retains and re-presents the last image to fill gaps.
Display-side low-frame-rate compensation remains the display's responsibility.
Historical `gap_fills_before` and `gap_fill_last_us` CSV columns remain reserved
and zero-valued to preserve trace compatibility.

## 12. Audio, input, and end-to-end latency

Audio has its own UDP/RTP queue, Opus decoding callback, and renderer/device
queue. See [AudioStream.c](moonlight-common-c/moonlight-common-c/src/AudioStream.c),
[audio.cpp](app/streaming/audio/audio.cpp), and
[sdlaud.cpp](app/streaming/audio/renderers/sdlaud.cpp).
Audio packet duration controls its sample cadence, independent of video FPS.

The SDL renderer requests at least 480 samples (10 ms) or three Opus frames,
providing buffering for audio jitter. It uses pending-audio and device-queue
limits (including 30 ms and 50 ms checks) rather than video timestamps to control
backpressure. Audio startup intentionally discards an initial backlog of about
500 ms; renderer reinitialization similarly prevents downtime becoming permanent
queued audio latency. Muting can suppress audio processing without retiming VRR.

Input goes from SDL handlers to common-library input APIs and a separate sender.

Windows/Linux DualSense waveform feedback (updated 2026-09-19) runs separately
from video and ordinary stream audio. A Bluetooth Sony DualSense/Edge with an
exact SDL HID device path can advertise controller capability
`LI_CCAP_HAPTICS_PCM` (`0x8000`) after its output backend opens successfully.
The client also advertises `ML_FF_HAPTICS_PCM` (`0x04`) in SDP. Vibeshine captures
48 kHz S16LE actuator channels 3/4 from its virtual USB audio interface and sends
5 ms stereo blocks using encrypted control type `0x5601`, unreliable ENet
channel `0x08`. Both flags and the versioned payload are a coordinated extension
in these forks; they are not an upstream Moonlight protocol guarantee.

The receive callback validates exact length, version, format, controller range,
reserved fields and sample count before copying into a bounded per-controller
queue. It never accesses Session/InputHandler objects that may be tearing down.
The shared worker resamples to 3 kHz signed 8-bit stereo with SDL's audio stream,
then sends SAxense-derived Bluetooth reports. Linux uses the controller's hidraw
node and verifies its kernel bus identity. Windows opens SDL's exact device
path with shared access, verifies Sony VID/PID and the Bluetooth gamepad HID
collection's report lengths, and writes through overlapped Windows HID I/O.
Output is padded to the descriptor's maximum report length while preserving the
142-byte waveform report's CRC offset. A pending write has a 40 ms completion
wait; timeout cancels and drains the operation before its buffer can be reused
or freed. This is not a hard bound on a faulty driver's cancellation completion.
Input stays with SDL; no kernel module or Bluetooth reconfiguration is added on
the client. USB and other platforms keep ordinary rumble. Native game haptics
must originate from the Linux Vibeshine host's controller
audio endpoint; game soundtrack audio is not a substitute.

Playback drops old/duplicate packets, resets conversion history on packet loss,
bounds its input and converted queues, sends silence on underflow/idle/removal,
and joins its worker before SDL closes the controller. It cancels SDL emulated
rumble when waveform playback starts and suppresses legacy rumble while active;
LED, motion and adaptive-trigger callbacks retain their own paths. Write failure
stops that waveform worker and logs the need to reconnect; ordinary controller
input continues. Hardware coexistence with other applications writing the same
controller still requires physical testing.

Adaptive triggers already use `SDL_GameControllerSendEffect` on Windows and
Linux, independently of PCM support. SDL owns Bluetooth framing/CRC. The shared
47-byte effect builder sets only trigger validity bits, preserving waveform,
rumble, LED and audio state. Callback admission and event consumption reject
controller indices outside 0–15; allocation and event-push failure release the
report safely. Failed SDL effect submission is logged. Trigger dispatch runs on
the input thread so controller removal cannot race its SDL handle.

The pinned SAxense source, license, research credit and adaptation notes are in
[`third-party/saxense`](third-party/saxense/PROVENANCE.md). Every binary embeds the
original/adapted covered source and both license texts, printable headlessly with
`--haptics-license`. Hardware-free validation is `tests/haptics/haptics.pro`;
passing it does not establish actual Bluetooth/game behavior. The suite runs on
Windows, Linux and macOS using a recording output and SDL's real resampler; a
virtual controller checks trigger payload dispatch. Windows CI builds the native
HID transport and runs the suite. Local 2026-09-19 validation passed on macOS
using isolated headers from the pinned common-library revision; Windows native
build, simultaneous physical waveform/trigger playback and deployment remain
unverified. The pre-existing local common-library checkout was left unchanged.

See [InputStream.c](moonlight-common-c/moonlight-common-c/src/InputStream.c) and
[input handlers](app/streaming/input). Mouse movement is coalesced/batched with
a 1 ms interval; the stream event loop normally sleeps 1 ms when idle, with
platform differences. Input does not wait for the next video target to be sent.

The inspected paths show no client mechanism that makes audio playout follow
VRR targets or makes VRR follow the audio device clock. Added video protection
therefore must not be assumed to produce a corresponding audio delay.

An end-to-end interaction contains client input collection/sending, host
simulation, host capture/encode, network transit, client receive/decode,
presentation, and physical scanout. Client statistics expose only portions.
Host-processing reports, local decoder/pacer timings, and RTT cannot be summed
into a precise physical latency measurement without defining non-overlapping
boundaries and obtaining the missing evidence.

## 13. Trace architecture and replay fidelity

### 13.1 Capture mechanics

`MOONLIGHT_VRR_TRACE` enables worker tracing. Local `.vrrtrace` output begins
with `MLVRR1\n` and stores independently compressed CSV chunks. A `.csv` path
selects CSV output. UNC capture paths are rejected to keep network I/O away
from frame delivery. `MOONLIGHT_VRR_DEEP_TRACE` requests deeper instrumentation;
alignment is the separate native raster option described above.

The Settings recording wrapper creates a unique per-stream folder under
`Desktop/vrr-diagnostics`, sets only the trace/deep-trace variables, and collects
the existing redacted session logging plus a small configuration manifest.
Export is an asynchronous, atomic ZIP containing only this capture's known files.
Active recordings are locked against export; previous environment values are
restored at stream cleanup. This shared Qt code is used on Windows and Linux,
with wide Windows file paths and rejection of mapped-network capture roots.

The writer consumes a bounded 8192-row MPSC ring. Producers reserve and publish
slots with atomic sequence numbers; the writer never owns a producer mutex.
A full queue or exhaustion of 16 bounded reservation attempts drops diagnostic
rows rather than blocking presentation. The background writer polls every 2 ms
when empty; formatting, compression and file I/O remain off the pacing thread.
The size policy uses a 512 MiB cap only after at least an hour of arrival-time
coverage. Clean-close footer accounting, row sequences, dropped rows, write
failures, and cap state therefore matter to replay fidelity.

External launchers choose one canonical trace path per application run; the
Settings wrapper chooses one per stream. Before a new
worker reuses an existing file at that path, it archives the previous connection
as `<base>-connection-1.<suffix>` (then 2, 3, etc., without overwriting an existing
archive). If archiving fails, tracing is disabled instead of destroying the old
capture. The canonical path and launchers' latest-trace links continue to refer
to the current connection. Each archived file keeps its own schema and footer.

Rows carry frame identity, receive/assembly/decode times, queue lifecycle,
controller decisions and resolved parameters, preparation/wait/submission
timings, native results and IDs, GPU readiness bounds, and optional deep/raster
evidence. Schema-5 decision rows now include `gpu_readiness_lead_us`; outcome
diagnostics include `gpu_readiness_applied_us` when the deferred D3D11 target-
boundary fence check or a synchronous Linux output poll measured
a completed wait. Linux hardware source-retirement polls do not populate this
field. Terminal rows may be emitted outside the controller-owning worker
and intentionally lack its live diagnostic state.

The optional schema-5 diagnostic extension records `decoder_output_us` separately
from `decode_complete_us`. The former is immutable FFmpeg output and production's
source-mapping anchor. When an explicit worker wait is material, the latter is
advanced to the post-wait clock as a conservative completion observation; it is
not formed by adding a residual wait to decoder output. Older policies may retain
their captured construction and use it for source mapping. Overlay client processing is
`present_end_us - decoder_output_us`, and queue/pacing subtracts `prepare_us` and
`present_call_us` and the explicit `decode_sync_wait_us` from that same interval. Older traces cannot reconstruct this
boundary exactly; readiness-to-submission is not an interchangeable latency metric.

Every row also records `session_latency_mode`, `session_readiness_hitch_feedback`,
`calibration_loaded`, `initial_cached_samples`, and `history_version`. The
`session_allow_tearing` column records the native permission. New sessions
always record it as enabled; historical captures without it default to enabled,
while replay retains an explicit false value from an older capture. Worker
decision rows have `history_state_valid=1` and scalar snapshots of history samples,
misses, duration, and release eligibility. These snapshots are taken at trace
enqueue, after the outcome, rather than at the earlier scheduling decision.
Nondecision rows have invalid/zero history snapshots. Cached sample count is the
startup prior, not current live evidence. No additional histogram calculation,
formatting, or I/O occurs on frame delivery; these additions do not steer policy.
The existing initial-profile column identifies the complete calibration snapshot.
Optional buffer-accounting fields also include `buffer_calibration_complete`,
`buffer_calibration_samples`, and `buffer_calibration_coverage_us`. They describe
live interval qualification, separately from cached readiness history. Replay
audits their values when present; missing historical fields are not invented.
Columns are appended without changing schema, retention, launcher environment,
or existing field meanings, so older replay readers can ignore the extension.

Presenter-reported submission time is used only when valid inside the observed
native-operation bracket; otherwise the worker boundary is used. Present return
time is not silently promoted into scanout time. Windows present-ready timing and
Linux output polls are CPU completion-observation brackets rather than
hardware timestamps. Source retirement alone remains outside those shared fields. The trace therefore cannot recover an
exact Linux hardware GPU-completion time or an exact Windows completion instant
inside the cadence hold.

### 13.2 What exact replay means

The parser supports schemas 3, 4, and 5, but the inspected strict
`fidelity.baseline_exact` gate requires schema 5. Some operational prose still
calls the launchers schema-4/replay-grade. Inspect actual captured schema and
gate results rather than trusting that label.

The baseline reconstructs the controller using recorded parameters, arrivals,
execution costs, configuration, and lifecycle. Exactness includes complete
sequence/footer accounting, valid timing relationships, required native/GPU
fields, matching controller decisions/diagnostics, simulated submissions,
refresh/raster classifications, and valid execution residuals. A JSON file's
existence or mostly matching timestamps is insufficient; require process exit
success and inspect `capture.recorded_sequence_integrity_valid` and
`fidelity.baseline_exact`.

Exactness proves deterministic reproduction within the recorded model and
evidence. It cannot repair incorrect instrumentation, such as a requested native
parameter recorded differently from the actual API argument. It does not prove
that a candidate policy would cause the same real host, network, GPU, or panel
events.

Current-policy replay and queue simulation select the shared prediction policy
regardless of native backend. Exact replay continues to use recorded parameters,
including historical Linux thresholded-event demand. Replay audits Vulkan's
historical texture-poll readiness rows with their recorded result and completion-
bound rules. Asynchronous Linux VAAPI captures can leave output readiness
unavailable; replay must not invent completion evidence for those rows. The separate strict Windows/raster diagnostic gate remains backend-specific
and may still reject otherwise reproducible Vulkan captures when its Windows-only
display evidence is absent.

### 13.3 Counterfactual model limits

Fixed replay retains recorded frame admission and lifecycle while changing
controller decisions. The `worker-occupancy-v1` decision-time model shifts
candidate decisions according to simulated prior submission and captured
post-submission gaps when the recorded worker was occupied. This improves on
reusing a stale decision time, but it is not a complete alternate execution.

A changed policy could change live stale-frame shedding, decoder backpressure,
queue admission, acquisition behavior, GPU cost, and later occupancy. Fixed
replay cannot synthesize all those changes. Worker-mode auditing checks candidate
capacity but does not provide a complete alternate renderer lifecycle or the
same raster simulation readiness.

For admission and discard changes, use the actual worker's deterministic backlog
tests. `vrrqueuesim`'s all-arrival event simulation is exploratory: it shares the
later stale checks but omits early queue pruning and service-aware decode-age
handling, and reuses captured service samples in sequence;
it does not reproduce counterfactual native blocking, decoding backpressure or
physical scanout. Its raw presented jerk, source-spacing residual, drop clusters
and latency distributions are distinct metrics. Unsupported display-only
injections are rejected. Do not treat fixed replay's unchanged admission or
its `stock_*` row as an actual fixed-refresh session.

`worker_saturated` identifies scenarios whose candidate occupancy shift exceeds
the model's useful cadence range (the implementation uses a median shift over
one source period). Their latency/cadence results must not be treated as valid
live predictions because fixed admission cannot shed frames like the worker.

Raster replay models software-visible phase exposure from native anchors,
geometry, and probe brackets. It can compare modeled VRR-following and
free-running scenarios. `optical_tear_confirmation_available` remains false.

## 14. Metrics and a useful investigation method

The overlay's `Incoming smoothness (host)` uses the last 30 valid source frame
intervals. Compute their population variance around their own mean, rather
than an expected interval derived from the requested FPS. For standard deviation
`sigma` in milliseconds, the score is `100 / (1 + (sigma / 6)^4)`. This soft curve
assigns almost no penalty to small variation: 1, 2, and 3 ms standard deviations
score 99.92%, 98.78%, and 94.12%. The 6 ms knee is a UI heuristic, not a measured
perceptual threshold or a probability of noticing stutter. It is deliberately
independent of the controller's 3 ms native hitch threshold.

Stable 30, 50, 60, or 120 FPS all score 100%. A 60-to-50 FPS step remains above
99.4% even while the window contains both rates, and settles to 100% after 30
new intervals. Larger cadence changes can temporarily lower the score while
both rates are in the window; timestamp data alone cannot establish intent.
Source stalls are included and age out after 30 subsequent intervals.

Measure raw host RTP intervals at decode-unit ingress before decoding and
pacing, with no local arrival timestamps or fallback presentation timestamps.
Missing, duplicate, or out-of-order frames and repeated/backwards timestamps
clear the window; normal RTP and frame-number wrap remain valid. Require 30
complete intervals (31 consecutive frames) before displaying a percentage;
otherwise display `N/A`. The tracker owns the window across overlay refreshes.
Stats aggregation selects the newest sequence-tagged snapshot, including a
newer unavailable result, instead of widening the window or averaging scores.
The existing roughly one-second overlay refresh cadence is unchanged; the
session-end log likewise shows the final window, not a whole-session percentage.
This identifies uneven host-supplied timing, which includes capture behavior;
it cannot isolate the game engine or detect repeated image content from timing
alone. It is independent of the native-confirmed client hitch metric and does
not change buffer adaptation.

For historical revision 3-5 policies, the stats overlay and session summary show
client readiness over a rolling 30-second outcome window, alongside the selected
target and a buffer-limit indicator. Revision 3 and later measure preparation completion against the intended
smooth deadline before late-readiness and display-floor recovery clamps.
Client playback drops count as misses; deliberate shutdown, suspension, and
interruption discards are excluded. A second row reports the percentages late
by more than 1 ms and 2 ms and the 30-second drop count. Drops have no invented
lateness magnitude. Window snapshots are selected by timestamp, never summed
across overlay refreshes. The window uses 100 ms buckets and starts with the
available outcomes before 30 seconds have elapsed. This remains a readiness
measurement, not a visible-smoothness score. With no eligible frames, the line
shows the starting state. Revision 4 applies the same thresholded-miss policy to
this score: through 1 ms is on time, 1-2 ms counts only above 50% prevalence,
and over 2 ms or a drop always counts. Production revision 7 instead reports
the interval buffer's one-second mean error and severity-weighted quality over
the preset's history window; these are not that older readiness percentage.

With deep tracing off, the overview retains the VRR17 frame queue delay,
rendering time, incoming host smoothness, VRR pacing/smoothness target, and
interval-error rows. The historical Smoothness label still denotes the client
interval-quality score, not measured physical display smoothness.

Advanced stats follow the worker's `MOONLIGHT_VRR_DEEP_TRACE` switch (value
starting with `1`), including the Settings tracing checkbox and external deep
trace launchers. Merely enabling an ordinary trace path does not expand stats.
Read the current Qt process environment, not SDL2-compat's cached environment,
so Settings tracing enabled before connection takes effect in both places.

The advanced VRR overview leads with applied buffer and its limit, followed by a plain
language explanation of the interval observer's latest action. It distinguishes
late-frame growth, capped growth, current timing pressure, unabsorbable work, a
remaining recent-pressure clean-time hold, release, minimum, and qualification.
The reason describes the request for subsequent frames, not a diagnosis of a
particular GPU/network fault. The client timing score and one-second error follow.

The average delay block separates GPU decode synchronization, frame queue time
(queue residence plus pacing/other), and rendering (preparation plus submission
call). These retain the existing accounting and successful-frame denominator.
An explicit GPU-ready wait is reported with measurement coverage and averages
only frames with a valid sample. On Windows the residual present-ready wait is
inside the submission call and therefore also inside rendering; the GPU-queued
decode dependency is not a separate CPU wait. Linux VAAPI Mailbox output uses GPU
presentation synchronization and has no CPU output-ready sample. Other Linux
imports and software frames report their completion poll inside preparation.
These rows do not measure total GPU execution. Applied buffer is a
schedule allowance, not another component to add to these measured times. The
normal and non-VRR overviews retain their original queue/rendering rows. Request values,
growth/capped-step ages, calibration counts, GPU head-start budgets, protected
submission share and submission jerk remain available in diagnostic telemetry
instead of crowding the overview. Neither timing quality nor submission jerk is
physical display smoothness. The trace extension
records the attributed late frame, attempted and clipped growth, and hold/
cooldown time. It does not change requested or applied delay. In particular,
the historical capacity flag can miss revision-7 growth that was already
clipped inside the observer; `buffer_clipped_increase_us` exposes that loss.

Submission cadence counts eligible
consecutive submission-predicted intervals with client-added spacing error over
3 ms. Motion jerk counts adjacent submission intervals differing by over 2 ms,
including host cadence changes, source stalls, and local drops. Neither proves
physical scanout or drives buffering. Native display/compositor intervals remain
separate tracking evidence. Cumulative counters are differenced into decoder
reporting windows, independently of the controller's five-minute histogram.
Failed-presentation diagnostics also remain internal.

Visible smoothness and source-timestamp fidelity answer different questions:

```text
presentedInterval[i] = presentedTime[i] - presentedTime[i-1]
presentedJerk[i]     = change between adjacent presented intervals
senderResidual[i]    = presentedInterval[i] - corresponding RTP interval
```

Use the replay's in-process `replay_presented_jerk_*`,
`original_presented_jerk_*`, and `stock_presented_jerk_*` fields, including tail
values and the share above 2 ms, when discussing overall visible cadence.
For the controller-only 99.95% goal, game-driven interval changes are not
failures. The new `simulation.sender_cadence.client_spacing_accuracy_percent`
uses a strict error greater than 3 ms; `client_spacing_errors_over_3ms` and
`client_spacing_pairs` expose the exact numerator and denominator. It excludes
source intervals over 25 ms, counts them separately as `source_stall_pairs`,
and does not exclude long local arrival gaps when RTP is steady. The older
`spacing_accuracy_percent` and 2 ms fields retain their historical contract,
including their sender/arrival exclusions, for comparison.

These replay spacing fields use submission timing as a presentation proxy.
Current revision 7 uses submission-interval error with readiness attribution to
control padding; native confirmation remains diagnostic. Historical prediction-
only policies instead derive padding from readiness prediction.
Report `smoothness_feedback.native_window_samples` and `native_window_misses`
separately. Sparse or missing native observations cannot establish 99.95%
visible smoothness, even when the observed miss count is zero. Counterfactual
native timing retains recorded service latency shifted with candidate submissions.
Raw presented jerk also includes the game's cadence and must be reported without
attributing all such motion to the client.

Desktop/idle captures are not gameplay tuning evidence. Confirm that the latest
capture contains the workload being optimized before selecting a latency versus
smoothness tradeoff. Keep source stalls, pre-arrival delivery gaps, decoder work,
and post-submission blocking separate when interpreting a sweep. A growing buffer
cannot necessarily fix a delay that moves with the submission target.

For an actual capture investigation:

1. Re-enumerate both `%USERPROFILE%\vrr-traces` and
   `\\allytwo\ChaseShare\vrr-traces` immediately before analysis. Use the newest
   completed capture unless the user names one. Record full path, length,
   UTC modification time, and SHA-256. Match sidecars by complete basename.
2. Run a fresh exact baseline with the current replay executable and check the
   actual exit code and fidelity fields. Failed exactness means exploratory
   evidence, not strict A/B proof.
3. Keep untouched baseline and candidate output separate. Batch named scenarios
   in one versioned config; use native replay parallelism instead of an outer
   shell loop. Automatic jobs are capped at 16.
4. Compare jerk/cadence tails, decode-to-submission mean and p50/p95/p99,
   submission drift, modeled spacing violations, raster bounds, and saturation.
   Report excluded source stalls and evidence gaps.
5. Choose a useful latency/smoothness tradeoff, then exercise nominal and injected
   decision/preparation/submission/scheduler disturbances with explicit interval
   and latency bounds. Severe fault latency is not normal operating latency.
6. After the final code change, rebuild the relevant diagnostic binaries and
   rerun candidate/stress results on the exact same trace. Pre-rebuild output
   cannot validate the final source. Generate a timeline only when per-frame
   causality or unavailable summary statistics require it.

Distinguish observed symptoms by boundary: packet/frame loss, assembly delay,
decode service, GPU dependency wait, preparation/acquisition, scheduler lateness,
intentional queue protection, submission behavior, and native/display evidence.
An average FPS counter alone can conceal all of these.

### Stats history graphs (2026-09-20)

The performance settings select one of three saved arrangements: text only,
text plus graphs (the default), or graphs only. The stats hotkey (keyboard,
gamepad combo, and the gamepad menu item) toggles the selected arrangement as a
unit through `Session::toggleStatsOverlay()`.
The graphs are a second overlay type, `OverlayDebugGraphs`, anchored top right
opposite the existing text, and are painted with QPainter by
`Overlay::Painter::paintStatsGraphs()` at a fixed pixel size, matching the fixed
font size of the text overlay rather than scaling with the viewport.
The stream-info chips distinguish a 10-bit source from an 8-bit renderer output
as `10-bit -> 8-bit` when the active renderer reports that output depth; the
D3D11, EGL and libplacebo Vulkan renderers provide it.

`Overlay::StatsGraphs` owns a sampling thread that reads cumulative counters
every 100 ms and keeps the last 10 seconds, plotting the difference between
consecutive reads. It plots, in order, incoming frame rate, rendering frame
rate, average host processing latency, frames dropped by the network
connection, frames dropped by network jitter, average network latency, and
video bandwidth. Sampling runs whether or not the graphs are visible, so a full
window is already present when they are brought up; painting and surface
publication happen only while they are on screen.

The sample interval is independent of the roughly one-second decoder stat
windows behind the text overlay, which are unchanged. Rendered and pacer-dropped
frames come from `Pacer::telemetrySnapshot()` directly, because the decoder
windows only merge that cumulative snapshot once a second. Incoming frames,
network drops and host processing latency are decoder-thread state, so
`submitDecodeUnit()` republishes those totals under a lock for the sampling
thread to read; the sum of the global and active windows is continuous across a
window rollover. RTT comes from `LiGetEstimatedRttInfo()` and is a gauge, not a
counter. Bandwidth differences a running total of the same `du->fullLength`
bytes that feed `BandwidthTracker`, because that tracker deliberately smooths
over 2.5 seconds of 250 ms buckets and would flatten a 100 ms graph; like the
`DISPLAY_BITRATE` text line, it is video payload without FEC overhead.

An interval with no decoded frames in it carries no new latency measurement, so
both latency graphs hold their previous value rather than plotting a zero that
would read as an improvement. Rates and drop counts do fall to zero, which is
how a stall appears. A counter that decreases, which happens when the decoder is
reinitialized mid-session, is treated as a new baseline rather than a delta.
Each graph auto-scales to the window's maximum, rounded up to the next
1/2/5 x 10^n and floored at a per-metric minimum so an idle graph does not
amplify noise. These are the same measurements the text overlay reports as
running averages; the graphs add time resolution, not new instrumentation.

## 15. Tests, deployment boundaries, and maintenance

The deterministic suites are
[tst_vrrtimingcontroller.cpp](tests/vrr/tst_vrrtimingcontroller.cpp),
[tst_vrrratepolicy.cpp](tests/vrr/tst_vrrratepolicy.cpp),
[tst_vrrpacingworker.cpp](tests/vrr/tst_vrrpacingworker.cpp),
[tst_vrrreplayconfig.cpp](tests/vrr/tst_vrrreplayconfig.cpp),
[tst_vrrrenderpolicy.cpp](tests/vrr/tst_vrrrenderpolicy.cpp), and
[tst_d3d11bindpolicy.cpp](tests/vrr/tst_d3d11bindpolicy.cpp).
The last covers the 4K decoder-bind vs compatibility-copy rule.
They cover timing arithmetic, timestamp wrap/rebase, cadence changes, delay and
history behavior, queue/drop/cancellation/suspension, ownership, wait floors,
trace integrity, native diagnostic modeling, and replay configuration/contracts.
Consult the test names and assertions for the specific behavior being changed;
the existence of a broad suite is not proof that a native API argument is tested.
`tst_vrrdiagnostics` additionally exercises capture scope, environment restoration,
export locking, file preservation and ZIP bounds; the independent Python ZIP
check verifies contents and CRCs. Windows CI includes that test and exact replay
of cold and warm-history worker fixtures under the unchanged production policy.

The ordinary application build does not build the opt-in replay/tests.
Follow AGENTS.md to build diagnostics separately and run all four suites plus
`vrrreplay --help` when required. Missing runtime DLLs are environment failures,
not pacing failures. No deterministic test here establishes optical tearing,
full host behavior, or physical A/V synchronization.

For the current Windows setup, ALLYTWO is this client and also the SMB server;
the Sunshine host is another LAN machine. The private live portable installation
is `\\allytwo\ChaseShare\MoonlightPortable-x64-6.1.0-vrr-lite`.
Keep its stable name. `AllyShare` is an open host-log drop and must not receive
release builds or profile/settings data.

An incremental local link is not publication. A requested ChaseShare update
also needs staging, changed diagnostics, refreshed ZIP, process-safety checks,
complete copy, source/live hashes, and the UNC replay smoke test. Preserve
`portable.dat.inactive`, dependencies, and tools; do not overwrite a running
gaming installation. Follow the complete commands in AGENTS.md rather than
reconstructing them from this architectural summary.

When maintaining this document:

- Update the baseline and affected explanations when active behavior changes.
- Follow resolver values through effective formulas, not only declarations.
- Follow intended native parameters through the actual API call and telemetry.
- Keep live policy, fallback behavior, historical replay modes, and optional
  experiments distinct.
- Preserve clock units, frame identity, queue ownership, and lifecycle order in
  every new diagnostic or model.
- Revisit exact replay whenever schema, feedback, policy state, or execution
  boundaries change; update both share launchers when their contract changes.
- Keep native Present arguments and telemetry aligned; validate the native call
  boundary and real Windows behavior before interpreting optical results.

The durable debugging approach is to trace an observed frame through the full
chain, identify the first boundary that differs from its intended behavior,
and check how that difference propagates into subsequent frames and feedback.
That keeps host stalls, local overload, scheduling policy, native behavior,
and measurement limitations from being conflated.


### Historical buffer-lag correction, 2026-09-10 (Linux growth policy retired 2026-09-11)

This update supersedes the expanding maximum and prediction-only Linux growth
policy described above. The absolute playout maximum is now 16 ms; a lower
source rate cannot expand it. Source-relative preset limits can still reduce it.

Linux enables `readinessHitchFeedback`, recorded as
`playout_readiness_hitch_threshold_us=2000`. Consecutive eligible submissions
must have a spacing error attributable to decode/preparation readiness beyond
the intended target before buffering can grow. Demand uses the delayed frame's
existing buffer plus the smaller of readiness lateness and spacing error, minus
2 ms. Catch-up uses the earlier frame's buffer, avoiding duplicate charges.
Host jitter, native blocking, or cached predictions alone cannot authorize growth.
Work or decoder backpressure beyond a source period breaks eligibility.

Version-19 reserve history retains/releases demand but cannot raise a cold-start
request by itself. It rejects old prediction profiles and does not add a second
3 ms margin. Existing attack/release and capacity bounds remain. Windows retains
its predictive growth rule. The new parameter defaults to zero for historical
traces; replay recognizes version-19 profiles and selects the current Linux rule
for declared Vulkan captures. Submission attribution is not physical scanout proof.

Controller, profile round-trip, replay configuration, and low-rate cap regressions
cover this policy. Live Desktop Mode evidence showed buffering releasing rather
than remaining at the cap; Windows-level visual parity remains unverified.

### Shared buffer policy and queue-stat accounting (2026-09-11)

The historical 2026-09-10 Linux readiness-hitch sections above describe the retired policy.
Production session setup leaves `readinessHitchFeedback=false` on both platforms,
selecting responsive adaptation with version-20 diagnostic history. The earlier
shared version-18 prediction-plus-margin law remains replayable.
Current-policy replay also selects this shared policy regardless of captured
backend; exact replay and explicit scenario parameters preserve version 19.
The changed queue statistic subtracts the explicit worker decode wait after
bounding it to non-render client time, preventing unsigned underflow. Native
render preparation costs keep their existing classification. This is an accounting
correction, not evidence that the GPU became faster.

Responsive-policy validation (2026-09-11): all four required deterministic
suites and profile tests pass. Eighteen 56-second controller fixtures cover
all presets, smoothing on/off, delivery/render/scheduler faults, and repeated
120/19/30 FPS transitions: clean padding stays at 1 ms and recovers near 1 ms
within eight seconds of the injected faults ending. A synthetic worker capture
passes exact replay and the five-scenario responsive-buffer stress config.
The latest completed live capture (20260911-181549-892) fails original-deadline
replay at frame 8355 in both the old and new binary, exit 3; no live A/B or
physical smoothness improvement is established. Existing history_* trace fields
refer to five-minute diagnostics, not the new live release gate.

### Linux Bluetooth DualSense feedback (2026-09-19)

The Deck client uses the same versioned 0x5601 waveform payload as Vibeshine:
48 kHz stereo S16LE, a sequence number, and at most 240 frames per packet.
The optional receive callback only queues bounded chunks; a separate worker
resamples to signed 8-bit 3 kHz stereo and emits SAxense Bluetooth reports.
Only a controller with an opened, kernel-verified Bluetooth hidraw path
advertises LI_CCAP_HAPTICS_PCM. See third-party/saxense/PROVENANCE.md.

In merged controller mode, startup opens attached DualSense controllers first
so the host's first player-0 announcement describes the actual feedback target.
Multi-controller numbering retains enumeration order. Rumble and adaptive
trigger feedback are routed by player index to the matching DualSense; SDL
remains responsible for input and non-waveform effects. Waveform teardown joins
its worker before closing SDL's controller handle. Physical feedback still
requires live validation; packet writes and tests do not establish sensation.

Deck validation: the native Qt build and waveform worker tests passed using
sdl2-compat over SDL 3.4.12. A live Desktop stream announced the Bluetooth
DualSense first (player 0, PlayStation, capabilities 0x80fb); host tracing
confirmed negotiated feature flags 0x7. One second of silent four-channel
48 kHz audio written to the virtual DS5 ALSA endpoint reached the client's
PCM callback and produced a 142-byte Bluetooth report. This proves the silent
transport path only. Physical rumble, adaptive-trigger resistance and native
007 First Light waveform output await user confirmation. The previous
binary is /tmp/moonlight-pre-codex-ds5 and the pre-edit source snapshot is
/tmp/moonlight-before-codex-ds5.tar.gz, with the common-c diff separately kept
in /tmp on the host workstation. No existing game/Steam settings were changed
by this Deck repair.

A launch request also carries a bitmap identifying attached PlayStation
controllers. Vibeshine can use it to delay a direct Proton title until its
virtual DualSense and Sony audio endpoint have enumerated, avoiding a one-time
game startup race without delaying launches for other controllers.

### Recovery validation scope (2026-09-20)

The worker now rejects expired queue fronts before decode synchronization. This
avoids spending GPU-wait time on images that were already too old to present.
Exact replay preserves these `queue_stale` terminal rows without advancing the
controller. `vrrqueuesim` does not yet model this early pruning; its counterfactual
backlog/throughput results cannot validate this recovery. Validation requires the
blocking-decode regression, exact worker fixture replay, and a fresh live stream.
No further buffer-number optimization is part of this recovery.

The subsequent completed `20260920-000347-249118` live capture exposed a separate
starvation loop: submissions stopped for 4.630549 seconds between source frames
486 and 1042 while the worker repeatedly synchronized decode and discarded the
now-ready frame on elapsed age. Decode waits themselves were tens of milliseconds,
not a multi-second blocked call. Immutable decoder-output mapping had also been
applied to discard age, making local GPU service count as replaceable backlog.
Current discard checks subtract only the current frame's explicit decode wait;
clock mapping, `stale_age_us`, full latency reporting, preset caps, and genuine
queue-age rejection stay intact. The deterministic reproduction fails before this
fix and passes afterward in all three presets. A worker trace exported with
`MOONLIGHT_VRR_TEST_EXPORT_CONTENTION_TRACE` covers exact replay separately from
the pre-decode pruning fixture. This establishes software progress in that
scenario, not 120 FPS throughput or smooth physical scanout under live capture.
The final native build and offscreen help pass. All nine VRR/backend suites pass,
and exact replay passes for the selected live trace plus contention, early-queue-
discard, and Windows cancellation-fence worker fixtures. Windows source changes
remain uncompiled here; fresh native integration tests are still required.
